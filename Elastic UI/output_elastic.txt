tablets) 250 mg and 500 mg BIAXIN® XL (clarithromycin extended-release tablets) 500 mg BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) 125 mg/5 mL and 250 mg/5 mL Antibiotic Abbott Laboratories,

BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin film-coated tablets) 250 mg and 500 mg BIAXIN® XL (clarithromycin extended-release tablets) 500 mg BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) 125 mg/5 mL and 250 mg/5 mL THERAPEUTIC CLASSIFICATION Antibiotic NOTE: WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH ACID ANTISECRETORY DRUGS AND OTHER ANTIMICROBIALS FOR THE ERADICATION OF HELICOBACTER PYLORI, THE PRODUCT MONOGRAPH FOR THOSE AGENTS SHOULD BE CONSULTED. ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY General BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin film-coated tablets), BIAXIN® XL (clarithromycin extended-release tablets) and BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) exert their antibacterial action by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria and suppressing protein synthesis. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori Helicobacter pylori is now established as a major etiological factor in duodenal ulcer disease. The presence of H. pylori may damage the mucosal integrity due to the production of enzymes (catalase, lipases, phospholipases, proteases, and urease), adhesins and toxins; the generated inflammatory response contributes to mucosal damage. The concomitant administration of an antimicrobial(s) such as clarithromycin and an antisecretory agent, improves the eradication of H. pylori as compared to individual drug administration. The higher pH resulting from antisecretory treatment, optimizes the environment for the pharmacologic action of the antimicrobial agent(s) against H. pylori. BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin film-coated tablets) Pharmacokinetics - 3 - The absolute bioavailability of 250 mg and 500 mg clarithromycin tablets is approximately 50%. Food slightly delays the onset of clarithromycin absorption but does not affect the extent of bioavailability. Therefore, BIAXIN BID* tablets may be given without regard to meals. In fasting healthy human subjects, peak serum concentrations are attained within 2 hours after oral dosing. Steady-state peak serum clarithromycin concentrations, which are attained within 2 to 3 days, are approximately 1 mg/L with a 250 mg dose twice daily and 2 to 3 mg/L with a 500 mg dose twice daily. The elimination half-life of clarithromycin is about 3 to 4 hours with 250 mg twice daily dosing but increases to about 5 to 7 hours with 500 mg administered twice daily. The non-linearity of clarithromycin pharmacokinetics is slight at the recommended doses of 250 mg and 500 mg administered twice daily. With 250 mg twice daily, the principal metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin attains a peak steady state concentration of about 0.6 mg/L and has an elimination half-life of 5 to 6 hours. With a 500 mg twice daily dose, the peak steady-state of 14-OH concentrations of clarithromycin are slightly higher (up to 1 mg/L) and its elimination half- life is about 7 hours. With either dose, the steady-state concentration of this metabolite is generally attained within 2 to 3 days. Steady-state concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-OH clarithromycin observed following administration of 500 mg doses of clarithromycin twice a day to adult patients with HIV infection were similar to those observed in healthy volunteers. However, at the higher clarithromycin doses which may be required to treat mycobacterial infections, clarithromycin concentrations can be much higher than those observed at 500 mg clarithromycin doses. In adult HIV-infected patients taking 2000 mg/day in two divided doses, steady-state clarithromycin Cmax values ranged from 5 to10 mg/L. Cmax values as high as 27 mg/L have been observed in HIV-infected adult patients taking 4000 mg/day in two divided doses of BIAXIN BID* tablets. Elimination half-lives appeared to be lengthened at these higher doses as well. The higher clarithromycin concentrations and longer elimination half-lives observed at these doses are consistent with the known non-linearity in clarithromycin pharmacokinetics. Clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. and omeprazole 40 mg q.d. were studied in fasting healthy adult subjects. When clarithromycin was given alone as 500 mg q8h, the mean steady state Cmax value was approximately 3.8 :g/mL and the mean Cmin value was approximately 1.8 :g/mL. The mean AUC0-8 for clarithromycin was 22.9 :g@hr/mL. The T max and half life were 2.1 hrs and 5.3 hrs, respectively, when clarithromycin was dosed at 500 mg t.i.d. When clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole, increases in omeprazole half-life and AUC0-24 were observed. For all subjects combined, the mean omeprazole AUC0-24 was 89% greater and the harmonic mean for omeprazole T½ was 34% greater when omeprazole was administered with clarithromycin than when omeprazole was administered alone. When clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole, the steady state Cmax, Cmin, and AUC0-8 of clarithromycin were increased by 10%, 27%, and 15%, respectively over values achieved when clarithromycin was administered with placebo. BIAXIN® XL (clarithromycin extended-release tablets) Pharmacokinetics - 4 - Clarithromycin extended-release tablets provided extended absorption of clarithromycin from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Relative to an equal dose of immediate- release clarithromycin film-coated tablets, clarithromycin extended-release tablets provide lower and later steady-state peak plasma concentrations, but equivalent 24-hour AUCs for both clarithromycin and its microbiologically-active metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin. While the extent of formation of 14-OH clarithromycin following administration of clarithromycin extended-release tablets (2 x 500 mg once daily) under steady-state conditions is not affected by food, administration under fasting conditions is associated with approximately 30% lower clarithromycin AUC relative to administration with food. Similarly, single-dose administration of clarithromycin extended-release (500 mg once daily) is associated with a 25% lower clarithromycin AUC relative to administration of clarithromycin immediate-release film-coated tablets (250 mg b.i.d.). Therefore, it is recommended that BIAXIN® XL (clarithromycin extended- release tablets) be given with food. Figure 1 illustrates the steady-state clarithromycin plasma concentration-time profiles for BIAXIN® XL (2 X 500 mg once daily) relative to BIAXIN® (500 mg twice daily). In healthy human subjects, steady-state peak plasma clarithromycin concentrations of approximately 2 to 3 :g/mL were achieved about 5 to 8 hours after oral administration of 2 x 500 mg clarithromycin extended-release tablets once daily; for 14-OH clarithromycin, steady-state peak plasma concentrations of approximately 0.8 :g/mL were attained 6 to 9 hours after dosing. Steady-state peak plasma concentrations of approximately 1 to 2 :g/mL were achieved about 5 to 6 hours after oral administration of a single 500 mg clarithromycin extended-release tablet once daily; for 14-OH clarithromycin, steady-state peak plasma concentrations of approximately 0.6 :g/mL were attained about 6 hours after dosing. - 5 - Figure 1: Steady-State Clarithromycin Plasma Concentration-Time Profiles for BIAXIN® XL (2 X 500 mg once daily) Relative to BIAXIN® (500 mg twice daily). BIAXIN ® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) Pharmacokinetics Single and multiple dose adult volunteer studies showed that the suspension formulation was not significantly different from the tablet formulation in terms of Cmax of clarithromycin and AUC, although the onset and/or rate of absorption of the suspension formulation was slower than that of the tablet. As with the tablet formulation, steady state is achieved by the fifth dose of a 12 hour multiple-dose suspension regimen. In children taking 15-30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses, steady-state clarithromycin Cmax values generally ranged from 8-20 :g/mL. Cmax values as high as 23 :g/mL have been observed in HIV-infected pediatric patients taking 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. In children requiring antibiotic therapy, administration of 7.5 mg/kg q12h doses of clarithromycin as the suspension generally resulted in steady-state peak plasma concentrations of 3 to 7 :g/mL for clarithromycin, and 1 to 2 :g/mL for 14-OH clarithromycin. In HIV-infected children taking 15 mg/kg every 12 hours, steady-state clarithromycin peak concentrations generally ranged from 6-15 :g/mL. - 6 - A single and multiple dose study conducted in pediatric patients showed that food leads to a slight delay in the onset of absorption, but does not affect the overall bioavailability of clarithromycin. Clarithromycin and its 14-OH metabolite penetrate into middle ear effusion (MEE) of patients with secretory otitis media. For adult patients, the bioavailability of 10 mL of the 125 mg/5mL suspension is similar to a 250 mg tablet. Single dose adult volunteer studies show that the reformulated (125 mg/5 mL and 250 mg/5 mL) and the current (125 mg/5 mL) clarithromycin for oral suspension have comparable bioavailability under fasting and non-fasting conditions. The results of the bioavailability comparisons are provided in Tables 1 to 8.

however, the 14-OH clarithromycin concentrations were lower in the hepatically impaired subjects. The decreased formation of 14-OH clarithromycin was at least partially offset by an increase in renal clearance of clarithromycin in subjects with impaired hepatic function when compared to healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin was also altered in subjects with impaired renal function. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Clarithromycin is contraindicated as concurrent therapy with astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride or pimozide. (See PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions). WARNINGS BIAXIN BID*(clarithromycin film-coated tablets), BIAXIN® XL (clarithromycin extended-release tablets), and BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) should be administered with caution to any patient who has demonstrated some form of drug allergy, particularly to structurally related-drugs. If an allergic reaction to clarithromycin occurs, administration of the drug should be discontinued. Serious hypersensitivity reactions may require epinephrine, antihistamines, or corticosteroids. - 13 - Several studies of HIV-positive patients receiving clarithromycin for treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex infection (MAC) have shown poorer survival in those patients randomized to receive doses higher than 500 mg b.i.d. The explanation for the poorer survival associated with doses higher than 500 mg b.i.d. has not been determined. Treatment or prophylaxis of MAC infection with clarithromycin should not exceed the approved dose of 500 mg b.i.d. Pregnancy Clarithromycin should not be used in pregnancy except where no alternative therapy is appropriate, particularly during the first 3 months of pregnancy. If pregnancy occurs while taking the drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Clarithromycin has demonstrated adverse effects on pregnancy outcome and/or embryo- fetal development in monkeys, mice, rats and rabbits at doses that produced plasma levels 2 to 17 times the serum levels obtained in humans treated at the maximum recommended doses. Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including macrolides, and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents, including clarithromycin. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of \"antibiotic-associated colitis\". After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to discontinuation of the drug alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an antibacterial drug effective against Clostridium difficile. General PRECAUTIONS is principally excreted by liver and kidney (see DOSAGE AND Clarithromycin ADMINISTRATION). In patients with both hepatic and renal impairments or in the presence of severe renal impairment, decreased dosage of BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin film-coated tablets), BIAXIN® XL (clarithromycin extended-release tablets) and BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) or prolonged dosing intervals might be appropriate. the The development of resistance (11 out of 19 breakthrough isolates in one study) has been seen in HIV positive patients receiving clarithromycin for prophylaxis and treatment of MAC infection. H. pylori Eradication and Compliance - 14 - To avoid failure of the eradication treatment with a potential for developing antimicrobial resistance and a risk of failure with subsequent therapy, patients should be instructed to follow closely the prescribed regimen. For the eradication of H. pylori, amoxicillin and clarithromycin should not be administered to patients with renal impairment since the appropriate dosage in this patient population has not yet been established. Antibiotic Resistance in Relation to H. pylori Eradication Triple and Dual Therapy with Omeprazole Among the 113 triple therapy recipients with pretreatment H. pylori isolates susceptible to clarithromycin, 2/102 patients (2%) developed resistance after treatment with omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Among patients who received triple therapy, 6/108 (5.6%) patients had pretreatment H. pylori isolates resistant to clarithromycin. Of these 6 patients, 3 (50%) had H. pylori eradicated at follow-up, and 3 (50%) remained positive after treatment. In 5/113 (4.4%) patients, no susceptibility data for clarithromycin pretreatment were available. Twenty-six patients 26/104 (25%) with pretreatment isolates susceptible to clarithromycin developed resistance after treatment with omeprazole and clarithromycin. Development of clarithromycin resistance should be considered as a possible risk especially when less efficient treatment regimens are used. Drug Interactions: Many categories of drugs are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme located in the liver and in the intestine. Some drugs inhibit and others induce this enzyme. Co-administration of such drugs may impact upon each other’s metabolism. In some cases serum concentration may be increased and in others decreased. Care must therefore be exercised when co- administering such drugs. Clarithromycin is reported to be an inhibitor of the enzyme P450 3A4. This may lead to increased or prolonged serum levels of those drugs also metabolized by the enzyme when co- administered with clarithromycin. For such drugs the monitoring of their serum concentrations may be necessary. The following lists some of the drug-drug interactions which have been reported between clarithromycin-macrolides and other drugs or drug categories. Like clarithromycin and omeprazole, most of the following drugs are metabolized by the P450 3A4 enzyme system. Additional mechanisms, such as effects upon absorption, may also be responsible for interaction between drugs, including digoxin and clarithromycin. Astemizole/Terfenadine - 15 - Macrolides have been reported to alter the metabolism of terfenadine resulting in increased serum levels of terfenadine which has occasionally been associated with cardiac arrhythmias such as QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and torsade de pointes (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). In a study involving 14 healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of BIAXIN BID* tablets and terfenadine resulted in a two to three-fold increase in the serum level of the acid metabolite of terfenadine, MDL 16, 455, and in prolongation of the QT interval which did not lead to any clinically detectable effect. Similar effects have been observed with concomitant administration of astemizole and other macrolides. Carbamazepine Clarithromycin administration in patients receiving carbamazepine has been reported to cause increased levels of carbamazepine. Blood level monitoring of carbamazepine may be considered. Cisapride/Pimozide Elevated cisapride levels have been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin and cisapride concomitantly. This may result in QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and torsade de pointes. Similar effects have been observed in patients taking clarithromycin and pimozide concomitantly (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Cyclosporine There have been reports of elevated cyclosporine serum concentrations when clarithromycin and cyclosporine are used concurrently. Cyclosporine levels should be monitored and the dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Patients should also be monitored for increased cyclosporine toxicity. Didanosine Simultaneous administration of BIAXIN BID* tablets and didanosine to 12 HIV-infected adult patients resulted in no statistically significant change in didanosine pharmacokinetics. Digoxin Elevated digoxin serum concentrations have been reported in patients receiving BIAXIN BID* tablets and digoxin concomitantly. In post-marketing surveillance some patients have shown clinical signs consistent with digoxin toxicity, including arrhythmias. Serum digoxin levels should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving digoxin and clarithromycin simultaneously. Disopyramide/Quinidine - 16 - Increased disopyramide plasma levels, resulting in ventricular fibrillation and QT prolongation, coincident with the co-administration of disopyramide and clarithromycin has rarely been reported. There have been postmarketed reports of torsades de pointes occurring with concurrent use of clarithromycin and quinidine or disopyramide. Serum levels of these medications should be monitored during clarithromycin therapy. Ergotamine/Dihydroergotamine There are reports that ischemic reactions may occur when clarithromycin is given concurrently with ergotamine-containing drugs. Concurrent use of clarithromycin and ergot alkaloids has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia. Fluconazole Concomitant administration of fluconazole 200 mg daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily to 21 healthy volunteers led to increases in the mean steady-state clarithromycin Cmin and AUC of 33% and 18%, respectively. Steady-state concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin were not significantly affected by concomitant administration of fluconazole. Lansoprazole/Omeprazole One study demonstrated that concomitant administration of clarithromycin and lansoprazole resulted in mild changes of serum concentrations of lansoprazole and 14-OH clarithromycin. However, no dosage adjustment is considered necessary based on these data. Clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. was given in combination with omeprazole 40 mg q.d. to healthy subjects. The steady-state plasma concentrations of omeprazole were increased (i.e. Cmax, AUC0-24, and T1/2 increased by 30%, 89%, and 34%, respectively), by concomitant administration of clarithromycin. The mean 24-hour gastric pH value was 5.2 when omeprazole was administered alone and 5.7 when co-administered with clarithromycin. To a lesser extent, omeprazole administration increases the serum concentrations of clarithromycin. Omeprazole administration also increases tissue and mucus concentrations of clarithromycin. Lovastatin/Simvastatin Rhabdomyolysis coincident with the co-administration of clarithromycin and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, lovastatin and simvastatin, has rarely been reported. Midazolam/Triazolam - 17 - Clarithromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of midazolam and triazolam and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these drugs. Rifabutin/Rifampin Co-administration of rifabutin or rifampin and clarithromycin has resulted in decreased clarithromycin concentrations. Clarithromycin has been reported to increase serum and tissue concentration of rifabutin and thus may increase the risk of toxicity. Ritonavir/Indinavir A pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the concomitant administration of ritonavir 200 mg q8h and clarithromycin 500 mg q12h resulted in a marked inhibition of the metabolism of clarithromycin. The clarithromycin Cmax increased by 31%, Cmin increased 182% and AUC increased by 77% with concomitant administration of ritonavir. An essentially complete inhibition of the formation of 14-[R]-hydroxy-clarithromycin was noted. Because of the large therapeutic window for clarithromycin, no dosage reduction should be necessary in patients with normal renal function. However, for patients with renal impairment, the following dosage adjustments should be considered: For patients with CLCR 30 to 60 mL/min the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%. For patients with CLCR < 30 mL/min the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 75%. Doses of clarithromycin greater than 1gm/day should not be coadministered with ritonavir. One study demonstrated that the concomitant administration of clarithromycin and indinavir resulted in a metabolic interaction; the clarithromycin AUC increased by 53% and the indinavir AUC was increased by 20%, but the individual variation was large. No dose adjustment is necessary with normal renal function. Tacrolimus Concomitant administration of tacrolimus and clarithromycin may result in increased plasma levels of tacrolimus and increased risk of toxicity. Theophylline Clarithromycin use in patients who are receiving theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline concentrations. Monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations should be considered for patients receiving high doses of theophylline or with baseline concentrations in the upper therapeutic range. Warfarin/Acenocoumarol There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effect when clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants are used concurrently. Anticoagulant parameters should be closely monitored. Adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary. - 18 - Clarithromycin has also been reported to increase the anticoagulant effect of acenocoumarol. Zidovudine Simultaneous oral administration of BIAXIN BID* tablets and zidovudine to HIV-infected adult patients may result in decreased steady-state zidovudine concentrations. Clarithromycin appears to interfere with the absorption of simultaneously administered oral zidovudine, therefore this interaction can be largely avoided by staggering the doses of clarithromycin and zidovudine. Others Interactions with erythromycin and/or clarithromycin have been reported with a number of other the cytochrome P450 system, such as alfentanil, alprazolam, drugs metabolized by bromocriptine, cilostazol, hexobarbital, methylprednisolone, phenytoin, sildenafil, valproate or vinblastine. Serum concentrations of drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving erythromycin or clarithromycin. Combination Therapy with Omeprazole and/or Amoxicillin For more information on drug interactions for omeprazole and amoxicillin, refer to their respective Product Monographs, under PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions. Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The benefits against risk, particularly during the first 3 months of pregnancy should be carefully weighed by a physician (see WARNINGS). Four teratogenicity studies in rats (three with oral doses and one with intravenous doses up to 160 mg/kg/day administered during the period of major organogenesis) and two in rabbits (at oral doses up to 125 mg/kg/day or intravenous doses of 30 mg/kg/day administered during gestation days 6 to 18) failed to demonstrate any teratogenicity from clarithromycin. Two additional oral studies in a different rat strain at similar doses and similar conditions demonstrated a low incidence of cardiovascular anomalies at doses of 150 mg/kg/day administered during gestation days 6 to 15. Plasma levels after 150 mg/kg/day were 2 times the human serum levels. Four studies in mice revealed a variable incidence of cleft palate following oral doses of 1000 mg/kg/day during gestation days 6 to 15. Cleft palate was also seen at 500 mg/kg/day. The 1000 mg/kg/day exposure resulted in plasma levels 17 times the human serum levels. In monkeys, an oral dose of 70 mg/kg/day produced fetal growth retardation at plasma levels that were 2 times the human serum levels. Embryonic loss has been seen in monkeys and rabbits (see REPRODUCTION AND TERATOLOGY). Nursing Mothers - 19 - The safety of clarithromycin for use during breast feeding of infants has not been established. Clarithromycin is excreted in human milk. Preweaned rats, exposed indirectly via consumption of milk from dams treated with 150 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks, were not adversely affected, despite data indicating higher drug levels in milk than in plasma. Pediatric Use Use of clarithromycin tablets in children under 12 years of age has not been studied. Use of clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP in children under 6 months has not been studied. In pneumonia, clarithromycin granules were not studied in children younger than 3 years. The safety of clarithromycin has not been studied in MAC patients under the age of 20 months. Neonatal and juvenile animals tolerated clarithromycin in a manner similar to adult animals. Young animals were slightly more intolerant to acute overdosage and to subtle reductions in erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes, but were less sensitive to toxicity in the liver, kidney, thymus and genitalia. Increased valproate and phenobarbital concentrations and extreme sedation were noted in a 3- year old patient coincident with clarithromycin therapy. Cause and effect relationship cannot be established. However, monitoring of valproate and phenobarbital concentrations may be considered. Geriatric Use Dosage adjustment should be considered in elderly patients with severe renal impairment. In a steady-state study in which healthy elderly subjects (age 65 to 81 years old) were given 500 mg every 12 hours, the maximum concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-OH clarithromycin were increased. The AUC was also increased. These changes in pharmacokinetics parallel known age-related decreases in renal function. In clinical trials, elderly patients did not have an increased incidence of adverse events when compared to younger patients. ADVERSE REACTIONS BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin film-coated tablets) Patients with Respiratory Tract or Skin Infections The majority of side effects observed in clinical trials involving 3563 patients treated with BIAXIN BID* were of a mild and transient nature. Fewer than 3% of adult patients without mycobacterial infections discontinued therapy because of drug-related side-effects. - 20 - The following adverse reactions were reported during these clinical studies or during post- marketing surveillance. Due to their spontaneous nature, adverse events reported during post- marketing surveillance may include patients treated for various infections and are not limited to patients with respiratory tract or skin infections. Body as a Whole headache (2%), asthenia, infection, back pain, pain and chest pain. Cardiovascular System As with other macrolides, QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, reported with torsades de pointes have rarely been and clarithromycin. Digestive System Metabolic Nervous System (1%), constipation, nausea (4%), diarrhea (3%), abdominal pain (2%), dyspepsia (2%), vomiting flatulence, dry mouth, glossitis, stomatitis, gastrointestinal disorder, anorexia, oral moniliasis, tongue discoloration, hepatomegaly and pseudomembranous colitis. There have been reports of tooth discoloration in patients treated with BIAXIN BID*. Tooth discoloration reversible with professional dental cleaning. is usually As with other macrolides, hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, has been infrequently reported with clarithromycin. This hepatic dysfunction may be severe and is usually reversible. In very rare instances, hepatic failure with fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases and/or concomitant medications. There have also been rare reports of pancreatitis. There have been rare reports of hypoglycemia, some of which have occurred in patients on concomitant oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, somnolence, depression, confusion, disorientation, depersonalization, hallucinations and psychosis. There have also been rare reports of convulsions. Respiratory System rhinitis, cough increased, dyspnea, pharyngitis and asthma. Skin and Appendages pruritus, rash, sweating; allergic reactions ranging from urticaria and mild skin eruptions to anaphylaxis and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred with orally administered clarithromycin. Special Senses Urogenital System Hemic and Lymphatic System Changes in Laboratory Values - 21 - taste perversion (2%), ear disorder, abnormal vision and conjunctivitis. There have been reports of hearing loss with clarithromycin which is usually reversible upon withdrawal of therapy. Reports of alteration of the sense of smell, usually in conjunction with taste perversion or taste loss have also been reported. hematuria, vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis and dysmenorrhea. eosinophilia, anemia, leukopenia and thrombocythemia. Isolated cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported. changes in laboratory values with possible clinical significance were as follows: Hepatic : elevated ALT <1%, AST <1%, GGT <1%, alkaline phosphatase <1%, LDH <1% and total bilirubin <1%. Hematologic: decreased WBC < 1% and elevated prothrombin time (1%). Renal: elevated BUN (4%) and elevated serum creatinine < 1%. Others Central nervous system side effects (including seizures) have been occasionally reported with erythromycin, another macrolide. In studies of adults with pneumonia comparing clarithromycin to erythromycin base or erythromycin stearate, there were significantly fewer adverse events involving the digestive system in patients treated with clarithromycin. Patients with Mycobacterial Infections In AIDS and other immunocompromised patients treated with the higher doses of clarithromycin over long periods of time for prevention or treatment of mycobacterial infections, it was often difficult to distinguish adverse events possibly associated with clarithromycin administration from underlying signs of HIV disease or intercurrent illness. (Other adverse reactions have been observed in different patient populations and during post- marketing surveillance. Please also refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS - Patients with Respiratory Tract or Skin Infections). Prophylaxis - 22 - Discontinuation due to adverse events was required in 18% of AIDS patients receiving clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., compared to 17% of patients receiving placebo in a randomized, double-blind study (561). Primary reasons for discontinuation in the clarithromycin-treated patients include headache, nausea, vomiting, depression and taste perversion. The most frequently reported adverse events with an incidence of 2% or greater, excluding those due to the patient's concurrent condition, are listed in Table 9. Among these events, taste perversion was the only event that had significantly higher incidence in the clarithromycin-treated compared to the placebo-treated group.

In adult patients, the most frequently reported adverse events with an incidence of 3% or greater, excluding those due to the patient's concurrent condition, are listed in Table 11 by the total daily dose the patient was receiving at the time of the event. A total of 867 patients were treated with clarithromycin for mycobacterial infections. Of these, 43% reported one or more adverse events. Most of these events were described as mild to moderate in severity, although 14% were described as severe. Incidence of adverse events was higher in patients taking 4000 mg total daily doses compared to lower doses (see Table 11). - 24 - Percentage of Adverse Events* in Immunocompromised Adult Patients Treated with Clarithromycin for Mycobacterial Infections Table 11 Adverse Event Presented by Total Daily Dose at Time of the Event 2000 mg (n=516) 1000 mg (n=463) Nausea Vomiting Taste Perversion Abdominal Pain Diarrhea Rash AST Increased Flatulence Headache Constipation SPGT Increased Dyspnea Insomnia Hearing Disturbance ** Dry Mouth 11% 7% 6% 5% 4% 4% 2% 1% 2% 1% 1% <1% <1% 3% <1% 16% 9% 7% 7% 6% 3% 2% 2% 2% <1% 1% <1% <1% 2% 0% 4000 mg (n=87) 40% 24% 29% 20% 17% 2% 11% 7% 7% 5% 9% 7% 6% 5% 5% * Related adverse events considered to be definitely, probably, possibly or remotely related to study events. ** Sum of patients with deafness, ear disorder, partial transitory deafness, and/or tinnitus. n= Number of adverse events A limited number of pediatric AIDS patients have been treated with clarithromycin suspension for mycobacterial infections.

Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference (p > 0.999) between the treatment groups for the number of patients reporting one or more drug-related adverse events. Thirty-three percent (33%; 45/137) of the patients in the triple therapy group reported adverse events considered possibly or probably related to study drug, compared with 32% (42/130) of the patients in the dual therapy group (p > 0.999). The rate of drug-related adverse events when evaluated by body system was very similar for both treatment groups. However, a trend toward statistical significance was noted for drug-related adverse events associated with special senses. The most common special sense adverse event was taste perversion, which was reported more frequently in patients treated with dual therapy as compared to triple therapy (18%, 23/130 vs. 9%, 13/137, respectively; p = 0.072).

Patients with H. pylori infection - Dual Therapy BIAXIN BID*/omeprazole Of 346 patients, 156 (45%) reported at least one adverse event. Adverse events associated with the digestive, body as a whole, and special senses body systems were the most commonly reported adverse events among clarithromycin/omeprazole-treated patients. Eighty-three patients (24%) reported digestive system adverse events. The adverse events occurring most frequently in the digestive system were gastrointestinal events, of which nausea (5%), diarrhea (4%), vomiting (3%), and abdominal pain (3%) were the most common. Fifty-seven patients (16%) reported adverse events in the body as a whole body system. Headache (5%), infection (3%), and pain (2%) were the most frequently reported events in the body as a whole category. Fifty-four patients (16%) reported adverse events in the special senses body system; taste perversion was reported by 53 of these patients. Adverse events by body system for all patients treated with clarithromycin and omeprazole are presented in Table 16. (Other adverse reactions have been observed in different patient populations and during post- marketing surveillance.

Three patients treated with clarithromycin and omeprazole died during follow-up periods; none of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug administration. - 30 - Few laboratory abnormalities were observed among clarithromycin/ omeprazole-treated patients. The incidence of possibly clinically significant hematology and serum chemistry variables was < 1% for any variable evaluated. BIAXIN® XL (clarithromycin extended-release tablets) The most frequently reported adverse events in adults taking clarithromycin extended-release tablets were diarrhea (6%), abnormal taste (6%), and nausea (3%). Most of these events were described as mild or moderate in severity. BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) The safety profile of BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) is similar to that of the 250 mg tablet in adult patients. (For additional adverse reactions and post-marketing experience please also refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS - Patients with Respiratory Tract or Skin Infections). As with other macrolides, hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, has been infrequently reported with BIAXIN®. This hepatic dysfunction may be severe and is usually reversible. In very rare instances, hepatic failure with fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases and/or concomitant medications. Allergic reactions ranging from urticaria and mild skin eruptions to anaphylaxis and Stevens- Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred with orally administered clarithromycin. There have been rare reports of pancreatitis and convulsions. 571/1829 (31%) of the patients who received clarithromycin for oral suspension reported at least one adverse event. The adverse events reported are summarized in Table 18: - 31 - Adverse Events Reported in Pediatric Clinical Trials Table 18 Body System Number (%) of Patients (n=1829) 168(9%) 2(<1%) 302 (17%) 285 29 15 (1%) 21 (1%) 2 (<1%) 21 (1%) 120 (7%) 69 (4%) 52 (3%) 6 (<1%) 571 (31%) Body as a Whole Cardiovascular Digestive - gastrointestinal - other digestive Haemic/Lymphatic Metabolic/Nutritional Musculoskeletal Nervous Respiratory Skin and Appendages Special Senses Urogenital TOTAL* * Patients with more than one event within a body system are only counted once in the total for that body system. Patients with events in more than one body system are counted only once in the overall total. The majority of the patients with adverse events reported events in the digestive (302; 17%) and body as a whole (168; 9%) body systems. The events occurring most frequently in the digestive system were gastrointestinal events of which diarrhea (7%), vomiting (7%), abdominal pain (3%), dyspepsia (3%) and nausea (1%) were the most common. Glossitis, stomatitis and oral monilia have also been reported with BIAXIN® therapy. Other adverse events included infection (3%), rhinitis (2.2%), rash (2.2%), increased cough (2.1%), fever (2.2%), headache (1.6%), conjunctivitis (1.1%), taste perversion (3%) and transient elevation of AST (0.9%). The majority of adverse events were considered by the investigators to have either mild or moderate severity. 375/1829 patients (21%) had a mild adverse events, 175/1829 patients (10%) had moderate adverse events and 20/1829 patients (1%) had severe adverse events. In the two U.S. acute otitis media studies of clarithromycin vs. antimicrobial/beta-lactamase inhibitor, the incidence of adverse events in all patients treated, primarily diarrhea (15% vs. 38%) and diaper rash (3% vs. 11%) in young children, was clinically or statistically lower in the clarithromycin arm vs. the control arm. In another U.S. otitis media study of clarithromycin vs. cephalosporin, the incidence of adverse events in all patients treated, primarily diarrhea and vomiting, did not differ clinically or statistically for the two agents. - 32 - SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE Reports indicate that the ingestion of large amounts of clarithromycin can be expected to produce gastrointestinal symptoms. Adverse reactions accompanying overdosage should be treated by the prompt elimination of unabsorbed drug and supportive measures. Clarithromycin is protein bound (70%). No data are available on the elimination of clarithromycin by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin suspension, USP) may be given with or without meals. film-coated tablets) and BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral BIAXIN XL* (clarithromycin extended-release tablets) must be taken with food. BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin film-coated tablets) Adults with Respiratory Tract or Skin Infections The usual adult dosage is 250 mg to 500 mg every 12 hours (see Table 19) for 7 to 14 days. Table 19 Dosage Guidelines Infection Upper Respiratory Tract Pharyngitis/tonsillitis Acute maxillary sinusitis Lower Respiratory Tract Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and pneumonia Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Dosage (b.i.d.) 250-500 mg 250 mg 500 mg 250-500 mg 250 mg For more severe infections or those caused by less susceptible organisms, the upper dosage should be used. In the treatment of Group A streptococcus infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days. The usual drug of choice in the treatment of streptococcal infections and the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever is penicillin administered by either the I.M. or the oral route. Clarithromycin is generally effective in the eradication of S. pyogenes from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of clarithromycin in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not presently available. In patients with renal impairment and a creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min., the dosage of BIAXIN BID* should be reduced by one-half, i.e., 250 mg once daily, or 250 mg twice daily in - 33 - more severe infections. Dosage should not be continued beyond 14 days in these patients. In patients with both hepatic and renal impairments or in the presence of severe renal impairment, decreased dosage of clarithromycin or prolonged dosing intervals may be appropriate. Clarithromycin may be administered without dosage adjustment in the presence of hepatic impairment if there is normal renal function. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori Triple Therapy: BIAXIN BID*/omeprazole/amoxicillin The recommended dose is clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. in conjunction with amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. and omeprazole 20 mg daily for 10 days (see CLINICAL STUDIES). For more information on omeprazole or amoxicillin, refer to their respective Product Monographs, under DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. (FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE USE OF BIAXIN BID* IN TRIPLE THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF H. PYLORI INFECTION AND ACTIVE DUODENAL ULCER RECURRENCE, REFER TO THE HP-PAC* PRODUCT MONOGRAPH). Dual Therapy: BIAXIN BID*/omeprazole In patients who are sensitive to penicillin-based therapy (e.g. amoxicillin), dual therapy with clarithromycin and omeprazole may provide a feasible alternative. The recommended dose is clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d plus omeprazole 40 mg q.d. for 14 days, followed by 20 mg omeprazole q.d. for 14 days (see CLINICAL STUDIES). Optimal therapeutic regimens consisting of a shorter treatment duration for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori are yet to be determined. Adults with Mycobacterial Infections - 34 - Prophylaxis: The recommended dose of BIAXIN BID* for the prevention of disseminated Mycobacterium avium disease is 500 mg b.i.d. Treatment: Clarithromycin is recommended as the primary agent for the treatment of disseminated infection due to Mycobacterium avium complex. Clarithromycin should be used in combination with other antimycobacterial drugs which have shown in vitro activity against MAC, including ethambutol and rifampin. Although no controlled clinical trial information is available for combination therapy with clarithromycin, the U.S. Public Health Service Task Force has provided recommendations for the treatment of MAC. The recommended dose for mycobacterial infections in adults is 500 mg b.i.d. Treatment of disseminated MAC infections in AIDS patients should continue for life if clinical and mycobacterial improvement are observed. BIAXIN® XL (clarithromycin extended-release tablets) Adults with Respiratory Tract Infection: The usual adult dosage is 1000 mg every 24 hours for 7 to 14 days. Clarithromycin extended-release tablets must be taken with food. Table 20 provides dosage guidelines: Table 20 Dosage Guidelines Infection Acute maxillary sinusitis Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis Dosage (Once daily) Duration (days) 1000 mg 1000 mg 14 7 BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) The recommended daily dosage of BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) is 15 mg/kg/day, in divided doses every 12 hours, not to exceed 1000 mg/day. The usual duration of treatment is for 5 to 10 days depending on the pathogen involved and the severity of the condition. Treatment for pharyngitis caused by Streptococcal spp. should be 10 days. In children with renal impairment and a creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min., the dosage of BIAXIN® should be reduced by one-half, i.e., up to 250 mg once daily, or 250 mg twice daily in more severe infections. Dosage should not be continued beyond 14 days in these patients.

Children with Mycobacterial Infections Clarithromycin is recommended as the primary agent for the treatment of disseminated infection due to Mycobacterium avium complex. Clarithromycin should be used in combination with other antimycobacterial drugs which have shown in vitro activity against MAC, including ethambutol and rifampin. Although no controlled clinical trial information is available for combination therapy with clarithromycin, the U.S. Public Health Service Task Force has provided recommendations for the treatment of MAC. In children, the recommended dose is 7.5 mg/kg b.i.d. up to 500 mg b.i.d. clarithromycin per day in two divided doses. Dosing recommendations for children are in Table 21 above. Treatment of disseminated MAC infections in AIDS patients should continue for life if clinical and mycobacterial improvement are observed. - 36 - PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION Drug Substance Proper Names: Clarithromycin USAN Names: Clarithromycin, 6-0-methyl-erythromycin Chemical Name: (3R*, 4S*, 5S*, 6R*, 7R*, 9R*, 11R*, 12R*, 13S*, 14R*)-4-[(2,6-dideoxy-3- C-methyl-3-0-methyl-alpha-L-ribo-hexopyranosyl)oxy]-14-ethyl-12,13- dihydroxy-7-methoxy-3,5,7,9,11,13-hexamethyl-6-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dime- thylamino)-beta-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl]oxy]oxacyclotetradecane-2-10- dione. Structural Formula: Molecular Formula: C38H69NO13 Molecular Weight: 747.96 Description Clarithromycin is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in methanol, ethanol and acetonitrile, and practically insoluble in water. The pKa of clarithromycin is 8.48; the pH of a 0.2% (Methanol:Water, 5:95) slurry is 8.8. The partition coefficient of clarithromycin is influenced by the pH of the water phase and polarity of the organic phase. For octanol (dipole moment = 0.25): water, the partition co-efficient varies from 5.63 to 46.0 for pH water increases from 2 to 8. The melting point of clarithromycin is approximately 225°C.

H. pylori Eradication and Compliance To ensure treatment success, patients receiving Triple or Dual therapy for the eradication of H. pylori should be advised to take all prescribed medication for the entire treatment duration. If for some reason the patient cannot complete the treatment, his/her physician should be consulted. MICROBIOLOGY Clarithromycin exerts its antimicrobial action by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. Clarithromycin is active in vitro against various aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram- negative organisms as well as most Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) microorganisms. The in vitro activity of clarithromycin is presented in Table 22. Additionally, the 14-OH clarithromycin metabolite also has significant antimicrobial activity which may be additive to the activity of the parent compound. Against Haemophilus influenzae, 14!OH clarithromycin is twice as active as the parent compound in vitro. However, for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) isolates, the 14-OH metabolite was 4 to 7 times less active than clarithromycin. The clinical significance of this activity against Mycobacterium avium complex is unknown. Clarithromycin is bactericidal to Helicobacter pylori; this activity is greater at neutral pH than at acid pH. The ranges of MICs of clarithromycin, 14-OH-clarithromycin metabolite and the MICs required to inhibit 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of bacterial are presented in Tables 23 and 24. Beta- lactamase production should not have any effect on clarithromycin activity. Cross-resistance to azithromycin has been documented. Attention should be paid to the possibility of cross resistance between clarithromycin and other macrolide drugs, as well as lincomycin and clindamycin. The in vitro data indicate enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas species and other non-lactose fermenting gram negative bacilli are not sensitive to clarithromycin. - 40 - Table 22 In Vitro Susceptibility® of Strains of Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria to Clarithromycin Microorganisms Gram Positive Staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus methicillin susceptible All Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Other coagulase negative staphylococcus Streptococcus pyogenes (GrA) Enterococcus Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus agalactiae (GrB) Streptococcus viridans Other $-hemolytic Streptococcus Corynebacterium species Listeria monocytogenes Gram Negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitides Campylobacter species Number of Strains Cumulative % of Strains Inhibited at MIC (mg/L) .031 .062 .125 .250 .500 1.00 2.00 4.00 8.00 16.0 32.0 64.0 25 126 151 59 27 48 97 26 41 15 19 11 7 39 56 6 30 - - - - - 89 1 38 95 86 78 27 28 23 3 - - 4 20 17 18 14 91 4 84 95 86 78 45 100 35 3 33 10 4 75 63 37 44 93 8 84 95 86 78 54 - 64 3 50 10 8 84 72 42 44 97 25 84 95 93 84 63 - 100 7 83 43 8 86 73 44 48 97 59 100 95 93 84 63 - - 16 100 80 12 87 74 45 48 97 61 - 97 93 84 63 - - 37 - 93 12 87 74 47 48 100 63 - 100 93 89 81 - - 80 - 100 12 87 74 50 55 - 63 - - 93 89 81 - 100 - - 12 88 75 50 55 - 64 - - 93 94 90 - - - - - 12 88 75 54 59 - 64 - - 93 94 100 - - - - - 12 88 75 54 59 - 68 - - 93 94 - - - - - - 100 100 100 100 100 - 100 - - 100 100 - - - - - - * MICs do not take into account the antimicrobial activity of the 14-OH clarithromycin metabolite. - 41 - In vitro Susceptibility of Different Bacteria to Clarithromycin Table 23 Microorganisms Mycoplasma pneumoniae Bordetella pertussis Legionella pneumophila Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Chlamydia trachomatis Neisseria gonorrhoea Mycobacterium avium Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare Mycobacterium chelonae Mycobacterium fortuitum Mycobacterium kansassi Pasteurella multocida Bacteriodes melaninogenicus Clostridium perfringens Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive) Streptococcus pyogenes Chlamydia pneumoniae Helicobacter pylori † Number of strains MIC (mg/L) Range 50% 90% 30 18 14 22 17 11 26 30 124 137 86 24 10 12 10 20 10 49 13 #0.004-0.125 #0.008-0.06 #0.004 #0.008 0.12-0.25 0.12 2-8 0.03-0.25 0.002-0.008 0.0625-4 4-32 < 0.25-4 - - 4 0.06 0.004 0.125 8 1 - 2.0 #0.125-0.25 #0.125 1.0-4 1.0 #0.031 0.03 0.25 8 0.25 0.008 0.5 16 2 0.25 >8.0 0.25 2.0 #0.125-0.25 #0.125 #0.125 0.25-0.5 0.5 0.06-0.25 0.17 #0.06 0.004-0.025 0.03-0.06 #0.06 0.016 0.03 0.5 0.24 #0.06 0.031 0.03 † Hardy DJ, Hanson CW, Hensey DM, Beyer JM, Fernandes PB.

Susceptibility Testing excluding Mycobacteria and Helicobacter Dilution Techniques to determine antimicrobial minimal Quantitative methods are used inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method43 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of clarithromycin powder. The standard single disc susceptibility test (using the 15 :g clarithromycin disc) and the dilution susceptibility test should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 25. Criteria for the Interpretation of Standard Single Disc and Dilution Susceptibility Tests except for H. influenzae and H. pylori Table 25 Zone Diameter (mm) Appropriate MIC Correlate (mg/L) Susceptible Intermediate* Resistant $ 18 14 - 17 # 13 # 2 4 $ 8 * Indicates that the test results are equivocal; therefore, dilution tests may be indicated. N.B. These criteria and the definition are in agreement with NCCLS. Documents M2-A644 and M100-S845. The standard single disc susceptibility test (using the 15 :g clarithromycin disc) for H. Influenzae should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 26. - 44 - Criteria for the Interpretation of Standard Single Disc and Dilution Susceptibility Tests for H. influenzae Table 26 Zone Diameter (mm) Appropriate MIC Correlate (mg/L) Susceptible Intermediate* Resistant $ 13 11 - 12 # 10 # 8 16 $ 32 * indicates that the test results are equivocal; therefore, dilution tests may be indicated N.B. According to the revised NCCLS 1997 and 1998 Guidelines, the zone diameter and MIC values reflect both the activities of the parent compound and 14-OH metabolite. A report of \"Susceptible\" indicates that the pathogen is likely to respond to monotherapy with clarithromycin. A report of \"Intermediate\" indicates that the result be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where clarithromycin is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high clarithromycin dosages can be used. This category provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretations. A report of \"Resistant\" indicates that achievable drug concentrations are unlikely to be inhibitory, and other therapy should be selected. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure44 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 15-:g clarithromycin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to clarithromycin. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 15-:g clarithromycin disk should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 25. Standardized Dilution Techniques - 45 - Standardized susceptibility laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard clarithromycin powder should provide the following MIC values for S. aureus and H. influenzae (see Table 27). test procedures require the use of Table 27 Standard Clarithromycin Powder MIC Values Microorganisms MIC (:g/mL) S. aureus H. influenzae ATCC 29213 ATCC 49247 0.12-0.5 4-16 Standardized Diffusion Techniques As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 15-:g clarithromycin disk should provide the following zone diameters for S. aureus and H. influenzae (see Table 28).

While gene probe techniques may be used to distinguish M. avium species from M. intracellulare, many studies only reported results on M. avium complex (MAC) isolates. Various in vitro methodologies employing broth or solid media at different pH's, with and without oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC), have been used to determine clarithromycin MIC values for mycobacterial species. In general, MIC values decrease more than 16-fold as the pH of Middlebrook 7H12 broth increases from 5.0 to 7.4. At pH 7.4, MIC values determined with Mueller-Hinton agar were 4- to 8-fold higher than those observed with Middlebrook 7H12 media. Utilization of oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC) in these assays has been shown to further alter MIC values. - 46 - Clarithromycin activity against 80 MAC isolates from AIDS patients and 211 MAC isolates from non-AIDS patients was evaluated using a microdilution method with Middlebrook 7H9 broth. Results showed MIC values of # 4.0 :g/mL in 81% and 89% of the AIDS and non-AIDS MAC isolates, respectively. Twelve percent of the non-AIDS isolates had an MIC value # 0.5:g/mL. Clarithromycin activity was evaluated against phagocytized M. avium complex (MAC) in mouse and human macrophage cell cultures as well as in the beige mouse infection model. Clarithromycin activity was evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis microorganisms. In one study utilizing the agar dilution method with Middlebrook 7H10 media, 3 of 30 clinical isolates had an MIC of 2.5 :g/mL. Clarithromycin inhibited all isolates at > 10.0 :g/mL. Susceptibility Testing for Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) The disk diffusion and dilution techniques for susceptibility testing against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria should not be used for determining clarithromycin MIC values against mycobacteria. In vitro susceptibility testing methods and diagnostic products currently available for determining minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) organisms have not been standardized nor validated. Clarithromycin MIC values will vary depending on the susceptibility testing method employed, composition and pH of the media, and the utilization of nutritional supplements. Breakpoints to determine whether clinical isolates of M. avium or M. intracellulare are susceptible or resistant to clarithromycin have not been established. In vitro Activity of Clarithromycin against Helicobacter pylori Clarithromycin has demonstrated in vitro activity against Helicobacter pylori isolated from patients with duodenal ulcers. In vitro susceptibility testing methods (broth microdilution, agar dilution, E-test, and disk diffusion) and diagnostic products currently available for determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and zone sizes have not been standardized, validated, or approved for testing H. pylori. The clarithromycin MIC values and zone sizes will vary depending on the susceptibility testing methodology employed, media, growth additives, pH, inoculum concentration tested, growth phase, incubation atmosphere, and time. Susceptibility Test for Helicobacter pylori In vitro susceptibility testing methods and diagnostic products currently available for determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and zone sizes have not been standardized, validated, or approved for testing H. pylori microorganisms. MIC values for H. pylori isolates collected during two U.S. clinical trials evaluating clarithromycin plus omeprazole, were determined by broth microdilution MIC methodology (Hachem CY et al., 1996)24. Results obtained during the clarithromycin plus omeprazole clinical trials fell into a distinct bimodal distribution of susceptible and resistant clarithromycin MICs. If the broth microdilution MIC methodology published in Hachem CY et al., 199624 is used and the following tentative breakpoints are employed, there should be reasonable correlation between MIC results and clinical and microbiological outcomes for patients treated with clarithromycin plus omeprazole (see Table 29). - 47 - Table 29 Susceptibility Testing for Helicobacter pylori in Patients Treated with Clarithromycin and Omeprazole MIC (:g/mL) # 0.06 0.12 to 2.0 $ 4 Interpretation Susceptible (S) Intermediate (I) Resistant (R) These breakpoints should not be used to interpret results obtained using alternative methods. General PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics for clarithromycin and 14-OH-clarithromycin metabolite following the oral administration of a single dose or multiple doses of clarithromycin are outlined below. Helicobacter pylori The presence of H. pylori may damage the mucosal integrity and defenses so that exposure to acid/pepsin, even in normal concentrations, produces ulceration. H. pylori displays potent urease activity which may produce an alkaline environment around the organism. Excess ammonia produced by urea hydrolysis is toxic to mucosal cells and may lead to parietal cell failure and/or to a disturbance of the normal negative feedback of acid to the antral G-cells which secrete gastrin. In addition, H. pylori produces catalases, lipases, phospholipases, proteases, adhesins and toxins. These enzymes may further degrade the mucous layer and damage the epithelial cell membrane. Also, the presence of H. pylori stimulates an active inflammatory response which contributes to mucosal damage. Gustavson et al. (1995)22 showed that concentrations of 39.3, 23.1 :g/g and 25.2 :g/g clarithromycin were achieved in the gastric mucosa 2, 4, and 6 hours respectively after administering 500 mg clarithromycin t.i.d. and that corresponding concentrations of the 14 hydroxy-metabolite were 3.2, 1.1, and 4.1 :g/g respectively. Similar results were obtained whether or not clarithromycin was given alone or together with 40 mg omeprazole once daily (Logan et al., 1995)39. Although the activity of the hydroxy metabolite is about half of the parent drug and its concentrations are lower, it may still contribute antibacterial activity. BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin film-coated tablets): - 48 - Pharmacokinetics for clarithromycin and 14-OH-clarithromycin metabolite was first studied following the oral administration of a single dose or multiple doses of BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin) 250 mg tablet. Single Dose Plasma levels were determined in 20 subjects following oral administration of a single-dose of 250 mg or 500 mg of clarithromycin under fasting conditions. Cmax occurred at 1.00 and 1.77 (mg/L) and Tmax were 1.5 and 2.2 hours, respectively for the 250 mg and 500 mg. (See Table 30, Figures 4 and 5).

The mean plasma concentration-time along the predicted curves for clarithromycin and 14-OH- clarithromycin metabolite are shown in Figure 6. At 250 mg twice daily, approximately 20% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as the unchanged parent drug. The urinary excretion of unchanged clarithromycin is somewhat greater (approximately 30%) with 500 mg twice daily dosing. The renal clearance of clarithromycin is, however, relatively independent of the dose size and approximates the normal glomerular filtration rate. The major metabolite found in urine is 14-OH-clarithromycin which accounts for an additional 10-15% of the dose with twice daily dosing at either 250 mg or 500 mg. - 52 - Figure 6: Mean Plasma Concentrations of Clarithromycin and 14-OH Clarithromycin vs Time Following Seven 250 mg B.I.D. Oral Doses of Clarithromycin - 53 - Most of the remainder of the dose is eliminated in the feces, primarily via the bile. About 5-10% of the parent drug is recovered from the feces. Fecal metabolites are largely products of N- demethylation, 14-hydroxylation or both. The steady state concentrations of clarithromycin in subjects with impaired hepatic function did not differ from those in normal subjects; however, the 14-OH clarithromycin concentrations were lower in the hepatically impaired subjects. The decreased formation of 14-OH clarithromycin was at least partially offset by an increase in renal clearance of clarithromycin in the subjects with impaired hepatic function when compared to healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin were also altered in subjects with impaired renal function (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). A pharmacokinetic study was conducted with clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. and omeprazole 40 mg q.d. When clarithromycin was given alone at 500 mg q8h, the mean steady-state Cmax value was approximately 31% higher and the mean Cmin value was approximately 119% higher than when clarithromycin is compared with a previous study at 500 mg q12h. The mean AUC0!24 for clarithromycin was 65% greater when 500 mg clarithromycin was given q8h rather than q12h. Neither Tmax nor half-life values appeared substantially different between the q8h and q12h regimens. When clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole, increases in omeprazole half-life and AUC0-24 were observed. For all subjects combined, the mean omeprazole AUC0-24 was 89% greater and the harmonic mean for omeprazole T½ was 34% greater when omeprazole was administered with clarithromycin than when omeprazole was administered alone. When clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole, the steady state Cmax, Cmin, and AUC0-8 of clarithromycin were increased by 10%, 27%, and 15%, respectively over values achieved when clarithromycin was administered with placebo. At steady-state, clarithromycin gastric mucus concentrations six hours post dosing were approximately 25-fold higher in the clarithromycin/omeprazole group compared with the clarithromycin alone group. Six hours post-dosing, mean clarithromycin gastric tissue concentrations were approximately 2-fold higher when clarithromycin was given with omeprazole than when clarithromycin was given with placebo. Clarithromycin distributes readily tissue concentrations that are higher than serum concentrations.

The significantly lower clarithromycin Cmax values and the later Tmax values suggested that the test formulation provided extended release of clarithromycin in vivo. The significantly lower degrees of fluctuation (DFLs) indicated that clarithromycin plasma concentrations fluctuated less for the extended-release tablet regimen than for the immediate-release tablet regimen. In the second study, steady-state plasma concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-OH- clarithromycin were studied in 32 healthy subjects under non-fasting conditions, administered clarithromycin extended-release 500 mg tablet given once daily or clarithromycin 250 mg film- coated tablets b.i.d..

The significantly lower DFLs indicated that clarithromycin plasma concentrations fluctuated less for the extended-release tablet regimen than for the immediate-release regimen. In another study, steady-state plasma concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-OH- clarithromycin were studied in 32 healthy subjects, administered 2 x 500 mg clarithromycin extended-release tablets (1000 mg) once daily under fasting or non-fasting conditions.

The clarithromycin Cmin values were similar when the extended-release formulation was given under fasting versus non-fasting conditions. BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) Plasma concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-OH-clarithromycin were studied in 22 healthy male adult volunteers following administration of 250 mg oral doses of clarithromycin granules for suspension. Each participant received three clarithromycin regimens: regimen A: 250 mg (10 mL) oral suspension in a non-fasting state (30 min after the start of breakfast): regimen B: 250 mg (10 mL) oral suspension in a fasting state (2 hrs before breakfast after a minimum 12 hrs overnight fast); and regimen C: 250 mg tablet in a fasting state. Mean plasma concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-OH-clarithromycin are illustrated in Figure 7 and a summary of pharmacokinetic parameters is presented in Table 39. The relative bioavailability of the oral suspension formulation compared with the tablet can be seen by comparing regimen B vs. regimen C. The difference in clarithromycin Tmax (3.30 ± 1.20 vs. 1.70 ± 0.60 h) with the oral suspension and tablet formulations, respectively, shows that the onset and/or rate of absorption from the suspension is slower. A similar trend is seen with the 14-OH- metabolite. For clarithromycin, Cmax was not significantly different between the formulations but for the 14-OH-metabolite, Cmax after suspension administration was significantly lower than after tablet administration. The extent of absorption of clarithromycin was not significantly different from that of the tablet as assessed by AUC, whereas for the 14-OH-metabolite, the tablet formulation was associated with a significantly higher extent of formation than the suspension formulation. - 60 - The difference between clarithromycin Tmax in the non-fasting and fasting states (regimens A and B) was 5.30 ± 1.90 vs. 3.30 ± 1.20 h, respectively; similarly for 14-OH-clarithromycin (5.80 ± 1.60 vs. 3.40 ± 1.20 h). Therefore, the onset and/or rate of absorption from the suspension formulation is slowed by the presence of food. For clarithromycin, Cmax was significantly higher in the fasting than the non-fasting state. The extent of absorption of clarithromycin and formation of 14-OH-clarithromycin were not significantly different in the fasting and the non-fasting states as assessed using AUC.

During the single dose phase, an oral 250 mg (10 mL) dose of clarithromycin granules for suspension was administered. The study was conducted in 17 healthy male adult volunteers. Doses were administered in a fasting state (2 hrs before breakfast after an overnight fast and 2 hrs after dinner). Mean plasma concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-OH-clarithromycin are illustrated in Figure 8. A summary of pharmacokinetic parameters is presented in Table 40. After a single and multiple dose administration of clarithromycin as a suspension formulation, times to attain peak plasma clarithromycin and 14-OH-clarithromycin concentrations were prolonged, as evidenced by mean Tmax values ranging from 2.8 to 3.2 and 2.9 to 3.4 hrs, respectively.

It was conducted in 28 infants and children ages 6 months to 10 years with pharyngitis, otitis media or skin infections. The single dose phase involved the administration of a single 7.5 mg/kg dose of clarithromycin granules for suspension (125 mg/5 mL) in either a non-fasting or fasting (2 hrs before or 1.5 hrs after eating) state. In the multiple dose phase, patients were given multiple 7.5 mg/kg doses (every 12 hrs for 4 or 5 days) of clarithromycin granules for suspension in a fasting state. A summary of pharmacokinetic parameters is presented in Table 41. Mean peak plasma clarithromycin and 14-OH metabolite concentrations after single dose administration in a fasting state were 3.59 and 1.19 mg/L, respectively. The differences in Cmax and AUC in the non-fasting and fasting group were not statistically significant. The study shows no deleterious effect of food coadministration on clarithromycin bioavailability in infants and children, similar to results previously noted in adults receiving the tablet formulation.

These values compare favourably with those observed in adults after multiple oral dose administration of 250 and 500 mg of clarithromycin. Cmax and AUC increase after multiple dosing as compared with values after single dose administration which is also comparable with data obtained in adults. This indicates that there is no unusual accumulation in infant and children. Multiple oral doses of clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg every 12 hrs for 7 days) were administered to 31 children ages 2 to 12 years with a diagnosis of secretory otitis media. Clarithromycin serum and middle ear effusion (MEE) concentrations were 1.73 ± 1.21 (range 0.16 to 4.96) mg/L and 2.53 ± 2.31 (range 0.39 to 10.62) mg/kg, respectively. In 16 of 24 patients MEE concentrations equalled or exceeded those in serum. The ratio of MEE to serum concentration was 2.48 ± 3.57 (range 0.19 to 15.31). 14-OH-clarithromycin serum and MEE concentrations were 0.82 ± 0.32 (range 0.26 to 1.53) mg/L and 1.27 ± 0.99 (range 0.24 to 4.20) mg/kg, respectively (Table 42). In 14 of 24 patients MEE concentrations equalled or exceeded those in serum. The ratio of MEE to serum concentration was 1.73 ± 1.4 (range 0.25 to 5.87).

CLINICAL STUDIES Mycobacterial Infections: Prophylaxis - 66 - A total of 682 AIDS patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/:L were enrolled in a double-blind study (561) with half randomized to receive clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. and the other half to receiving matching placebo b.i.d. patients. Median duration of clarithromycin was 10.6 months vs. 8.2 months for placebo. More patients in the placebo arm than the clarithromycin arm discontinued prematurely from the study (75.6% and 67.4%, respectively). However, if premature discontinuations due to MAC or death are excluded, approximately equal percentages of patients on each arm (54.8% on clarithromycin and 52.5% on placebo) discontinued study drug early for other reasons. In patients randomized to clarithromycin, the risk of MAC bacteremia was reduced by 69% compared to placebo. The difference between groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), in both the USA and Europe (p#0.004). A statistically significant 28% reduction in mortality was also observed (p<0.014) (see Figure 9). Other clinical benefits of clarithromycin prophylaxis included statistically significant (p<0.05) reduced risk of hospitalization (by 24%) and reduced risks (by >80%) of developing symptoms associated with MAC bacteremia, such as weight loss, pyrexia, night sweats or anemia. Significant delayed declines in the physical functioning and energy/fatigue life determinations were also seen (p<0.05) (see Table 43). the quality of factors of On an intent-to-treat basis, the one-year cumulative incidence of MAC bacteremia was 5.0% for patients randomized to clarithromycin and 19.4% for patients randomized to placebo (see Table 44). While only 19 of the 341 patients randomized to clarithromycin developed MAC, 11 of these cases were resistant to clarithromycin. The patients with resistant MAC bacteremia had a median baseline CD4 count of 10 cells/mm3 (range 2 - 25 cells/mm3). Information regarding the clinical course and response to treatment of the patients with resistant MAC bacteremia is limited. The 8 patients who received clarithromycin and developed susceptible MAC bacteremia had a median baseline CD4 count of 25 cells/mm3 (range 10 - 80 cells/mm3). Comparatively, 53 of the 341 placebo patients developed MAC; none of these isolates were resistant to clarithromycin. The median baseline CD4 count was 15 cells/mm3 for placebo patients that developed MAC. - 67 - Summary of Efficacy Results in Immunocompromised Adult Patients Receiving Prophylaxis Against M. avium Complex Table 43 MAC bacteremia # patients developed MAC Survival # patients died Clarithromycin Placebo Hazard Ratio (95% CI) p-value Risk reduction 19/333 (5.7%) 53/334 (15.9%) 0.307 (0.177, 0.533) < 0.001* - 69.3% 106/341 (31.1%) 136/341 (39.9%) 0.710 (0.533, 0.934) 0.014* - 28.2% Emergence of MAC Signs/Symptoms Wt. loss > 10% Moderate/severe pyrexia Moderate/severe night sweats Mod./severe night sweats or pyrexia Moderate/severe anemia Grade 3 or 4 LFT # meeting criterion/total 5/333 (2%) 2/332 (<1%) # meeting criterion/total 23/322 (7%) 10/329 (3%) 0.179 (0.067, 0.481) 0.191 (0.041, 0.883) 1/325 (<1%) 7/327 (2%) 0.130 (0.016, 1.081) 0.001* 0.034* 0.059 - 82.1% - 80.9% - 87.0% 2/325 (<1%) 13/326 (4%) 0.140 (0.031, 0.632) 0.011* - 86.0% 0/319 (0%) 12/321 (4%) 0 3/325 (<1%) 2/318 (< 1%) 0.739 (0.118, 4.649) 0.747 Quality of Life Subscores (time to first decrease of $10 points) Overall health Physical function Role function Social function Cognitive function Pain Mental Health Energy/fatigue Health distress Quality of life Hospitalization # patients hospitalized # meeting criterion/total 180/317 (57%) 210/299 (70%) 111/189 (59%) 187/327 (57%) 174/336 (52%) 201/331 (61%) 179/336 (53%) 208/328 (63%) 170/335 (51%) 199/330 (60%) # meeting criterion/total 184/318 (58%) 236/306 (77%) 131/211 (62%) 197/331 (60%) 170/339 (50%) 217/336 (65%) 184/338 (54%) 217/335 (65%) 191/335 (57%) 199/333 (60%) 0.809 (0.645, 1.015) 0.781 (0.637, 0.956) 0.922 (0.690, 1.233) 0.823 (0.662, 1.024) 0.990 (0.790, 1.240) 0.902 (0.731, 1.113) 0.842 (0.672, 1.055) 0.784 (0.636, 0.966) 0.807 (0.647, 1.007) 0.902 (0.727, 1.120) 0.068 0.017* 0.585 0.08 0.929 0.355 0.134 0.022* 0.057 0.352 - 21.9% - 21.6% 166/339 (49%) 189/330 (57%) 0.764 (0.610, 0.955) 0.018* - 23.6% - 68 - Figure 9: Survival of All Randomized Immunocompromized Adult Patients Receiving Prophylaxis Against M. avium Complex or Placebo - 69 - Table 44 Cumulative Incidence of MAC Bacteremia and Mortality in Immunocompromised Adult Patients Receiving Prophylaxis Against M. avium Complex Cumulative Incidence of MAC Bacteremia‡ Cumulative Mortality Clarithromycin 1.0 % 5.0 % 10.1 % Placebo 9.5 % 19.4 % 26.8 % Clarithromycin 6.4 % 20.8 % 36.8 % Placebo 9.3 % 29.7 % 46.8 % 6 month 12 month 18 month ‡ from Kaplan-Meier estimates Since the analysis at 18 months includes patients no longer receiving prophylaxis the survival benefit of clarithromycin may be underestimated. Treatment of Mycobacterial Infections Three randomized studies (500, 577, and 521) compared different dosages of clarithromycin in patients with CDC-defined AIDS and CD4 counts <100 cells/:L. These studies accrued patients from May 1991 to March 1992. Study 500 was randomized, double-blind; Study 577 was open- label compassionate use. Both studies used 500 and 1000 mg b.i.d. doses; Study 500 also had a 2000 mg b.i.d. group. Study 521 was a pediatric study at 3.75, 7.5, and 15 mg/kg b.i.d. Study 500 enrolled 154 adult patients, Study 577 enrolled 469 adult patients, and Study 521 enrolled 25 patients between the ages of 1-20 months. The majority of patients had CD4 cell counts <50 cells/:L at study entry. The studies were designed to evaluate the following end points: 1. Change in MAC bacteremia or blood cultures negative for M. avium. 2. Change in clinical signs and symptoms of MAC infection including one or more of the following: fever, night sweats, weight loss, diarrhea, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. The results of the 500 study are described below. The 577 study results were similar to the results of the 500 study. Results with the 7.5 mg/kg b.i.d. dose in the pediatric study were comparable to those for the 500 mg b.i.d. regimen in the adult studies. MAC bacteremia Decreases in MAC bacteremia or negative blood cultures were seen in the majority of patients in all dose groups. Mean reductions in colony forming units (CFU) are shown below. Included in the table are results from a separate study with a four drug regimen (ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, rifampicin, and clofazimine). Since patient populations and study procedures may vary between these two studies, comparisons between the clarithromycin results and the combination therapy results should be interpreted cautiously (Table 45). - 70 - Table 45 Mean Reductions in Log CFU from Baseline (After 4 Weeks of Therapy) 500 mg b.i.d. 1000 mg b.i.d. 2000 mg b.i.d. Four Drug Regimen (N=35) 1.5 (N=32) 2.3 (N=26) 2.3 (N=24) 1.4 Although the 1000 mg and 2000 mg b.i.d. doses showed significantly better control of bacteremia during the first four weeks during therapy, no significant differences were seen beyond that point. The percent of patients whose blood was sterilized as shown by one or more negative cultures at any time during acute therapy was 61% (30/49) for the 500 mg b.i.d. group and 59% (29/49) and 52% (25/28) for the 1000 and 2000 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively. The percent of patients who had 2 or more negative cultures during acute therapy that were sustained through study Day 84 was 25% (12/49) in both the 500 and 1000 mg b.i.d. groups and 8% (4/48) for the 2000 mg b.i.d. group. By Day 84, 23%(11/49), 37% (18/49), and 56% (27/48) of patients had died or discontinued from the study, and 14% (7/49), 12% (6/49), and 13% (6/48) of patients had relapsed in the 500, 1000, and 2000 mg b.i.d. dose groups, respectively. All of the isolates had an MIC <8 :g/mL at pretreatment. Relapse was almost always accompanied by an increase in MIC. The median time to first negative culture was 54, 41, and 29 days for the 500, 1000, and 2000 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively. Clinically significant disseminated MAC Disease Among patients experiencing night sweats prior to therapy, 84% showed resolution or improvement at some point during the 12 weeks of clarithromycin at 500-2000 mg b.i.d. doses. Similarly, 77% of patients reported resolution or improvement in fevers at some point. Response rates for clinical signs of MAC are given in Table 46. - 71 - Response Rates for Clinical Signs of MAC Table 46 Resolution of Fever Resolution of Night Sweats b.i.d. dose (mg) 500 1000 2000 b.i.d. dose (mg) 500 1000 2000 % ever afebrile % afebrile $ 6 weeks 67 67 62 23 12 22 b.i.d dose (mg) 500 1000 2000 % ever resolving % resolving $ 6 weeks 85 70 72 42 33 36 Weight Gain , 3% Hemoglobin Increase , 1 g % ever gaining % gaining $ 6 weeks 33 26 26 14 17 12 b.i.d. dose (mg) 500 1000 2000 % ever increasing %increasing $ 6 weeks 58 37 62 26 6 18 The median duration of response, defined as improvement of resolution of clinical signs and symptoms, was 2-6 weeks. Since the study was not designed to determine the benefit of monotherapy beyond 12 weeks, the duration of response may be underestimated for the 25-33% of patients who continued to show clinical response after 12 weeks. Survival Median survival time from study entry (Study 500) was 249 days at the 500 mg b.i.d. dose compared to 215 days with the 1000 mg b.i.d. dose. However, during the first 12 weeks of therapy, there were 2 deaths in 53 patients in the 500 mg b.i.d. group versus 13 deaths in 51 patients in the 1000 mg b.i.d. group. The reason for this apparent mortality difference is not known. Survival in the two groups was similar beyond 12 weeks. The median survival times for these dosages were similar to recent historical controls with MAC when treated with combination therapies. Median survival time from study entry in Study 577 was 199 days for the 500 mg b.i.d. dose and 179 days for the 1000 mg b.i.d. dose. During the first four weeks of therapy, while patients were maintained on their originally assigned dose, there were 11 deaths in 255 patients taking 500 mg b.i.d. and 18 deaths in 214 patients taking 1000 mg b.i.d. Otitis Media - 72 - In a controlled clinical study of acute otitis media performed in the United States, where significant rates of beta-lactamase producing organisms were found, clarithromycin was compared to an oral cephalosporin. In a small number of patients, microbiologic determinations were made at the pre-treatment visit. Table 47 summarizes the presumptive bacterial eradications/clinical cure outcomes (i.e., clinical success).

The incidence of adverse events in all patients treated, primarily diarrhea (15% vs. 38%) and diaper rash (3% vs. 11%) in young children, was clinically or statistically lower in the clarithromycin arm vs. the control arm. In two other controlled clinical trials of acute otitis media performed in the United States, where significant rates of beta-lactamase producing organisms were found, clarithromycin was compared to an oral antimicrobial agent that contained a specific beta-lactamase inhibitor. For the patients who had microbiologic determinations at the pre-treatment visit, Table 48 summarizes the presumptive bacterial eradication/clinical cure outcomes (i.e., clinical success). - 73 - Table 48 Two U.S. Acute Otitis Media Studies Clarithromycin vs. Antimicrobial/ Beta-Lactamase Inhibitor PATHOGEN S. pneumoniae H. influenzae* M. catarrhalis S. pyogenes Overall EFFICACY RESULTS OUTCOME clarithromycin success rate, 43/51 (84%), control 55/56 (98%) clarithromycin success rate, 36/45 (80%), control 31/33 (94%) clarithromycin success rate, 9/10 (90%), control 6/6 clarithromycin success rate, 3/3, control 5/5 clarithromycin success rate, 91/109 (83%), control 97/100 (97%) * Of the H. influenzae isolated pre-treatment, 3% were resistant to clarithromycin and 10% were resistant to the control agent. The incidence of adverse events in all patients treated, primarily diarrhea and vomiting, did not differ clinically or statistically for the two agents. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed prior to initiating treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection and to determine their susceptibilities to clarithromycin. Therapy with clarithromycin may be initiated before results of these tests are known. However, modification of this treatment may be required once results become available or if there is no clinical improvement. Eradication of H. pylori -Triple Therapy BIAXIN BID*/omeprazole/amoxicillin In a well controlled double-blind study, H. pylori infected duodenal ulcer patients received triple therapy with clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1000 mg b.i.d. and omeprazole 20 mg daily for 10 days or dual therapy with clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. and omeprazole 40 mg daily for 14 days. H. pylori was eradicated in 90% of the patients receiving clarithromycin triple therapy and in 60% of the patients receiving dual therapy. The ulcer healing rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are presented in Table 49. - 74 - Ulcer Healing [95% C.I.] at Four to Six Weeks Follow-up Table 49 Patient Subset Clarithromycin + Omeprazole + Amoxicillin Clarithromycin + Omeprazole Clinically Evaluable Intent-to-Treat #1 Intent-to-Treat #2 93% (118/127) [87.0, 96.7] 93% (122/131) [87.4, 96.8] 91% (104/114) [84.5, 95.7] 92% (111/121) [85.3, 96.0] 90% (122/136) [83.3, 94.3] 85% (111/130) [78.1, 91.0] p-value 0.641 0.812 0.353 C An ulcer was defined as a circumscribed break in the duodenal mucosa that measured 5 to 25 mm in the longest diameter with apparent depth and was covered with an exudate.

The H. pylori eradication rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are summarized in Table 50. For all patient subsets, triple therapy with clarithromycin, omeprazole, and amoxicillin achieved a statistically higher eradication rate than dual therapy (p < 0.001). These differences were also observed when the eradication rates were adjusted for potentially influential factors such as ulcer characteristics, age, and smoking. In addition, the eradication rates within each treatment group were similar for smokers and non-smokers. - 75 - Global Eradication [95% C.I.] at Four- to Six-Week Follow-up Table 50 Bacteriologically Evaluable Intent-to-Treat #1 Intent-to-Treat #2 Omeprazole + Clarithromycin + Amoxicillin 91% (115/127) [84.1, 95.0] 90% (120/133) [83.9, 94.7] 88% (120/136) [81.6, 93.1] Omeprazole + Clarithromycin 59% (68/115) [49.6, 68.2] 60% (72/120) [50.7, 68.8] 55% (72/130) [46.4, 64.1] p-value <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 C An ulcer was defined as a circumscribed break in the duodenal mucosa that measured 5 to 25 mm in the longest diameter with apparent depth and was covered with an exudate.

In an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving more than 100 patients in each of six treatment groups, patients with proven duodenal ulcer disease were randomized to treatment twice daily for 1 week with omeprazole, 20 mg (O), plus either placebo (P) or combinations of two of the following antimicrobials: amoxicillin, 1g (A), clarithromycin, 250 mg or 500 mg (C250, C500), or metronidazole, 400 mg (M). H. pylori eradication rates for the “all-patients-treated” analysis were 96% (OAC500), 95% (OMC250), 90% (OMC500), 84% (OAC250), 79% (OAM), and 1% (OP). In an independent, open, and non-randomized study, H. pylori infected patients received eradication therapy with clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. in conjunction with amoxicillin 1000 mg b.i.d. and omeprazole 20 mg q.d. (Group A) or omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. (Group B) for 7 days. In those patients not previously treated with anti-H. pylori therapy, H. pylori was eradicated in 88% of patients in Group A and 86% of patients in Group B. (For additional information on the use of Biaxin BID* in triple therapy for the treatment of H. pylori infection and active duodenal ulcer recurrence, refer to the Hp-PAC* Product Monograph). Eradication of Helicobacter pylori- Dual Therapy - 76 - Helicobacter pylori is strongly associated with peptic ulcer disease. Ninety to 100% of patients with duodenal ulcers are infected with this pathogen. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the rate of duodenal ulcer recurrence, thereby reducing the need for maintenance anti-secretory therapy. In four well controlled, double-blind studies, H. pylori infected duodenal ulcer patients received eradication therapy with clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. and omeprazole 40 mg daily for fourteen days followed by omeprazole 40 mg (study A) or omeprazole 20 mg (studies B, C and D) daily for an additional 14 days; patients in each control group received omeprazole alone for 28 days.

The median lethal dose by the oral route ranged from 2.7 - > 5.0 g/kg. Acute toxicity did not differ markedly between sexes (Table 51).

The emetic activity of clarithromycin prevented The acute oral toxicity of clarithromycin in very young mice and rats was determined. The median lethal dose (1.2 g/kg) was about 2 fold that seen in the older rodents. BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) - 81 - Clarithromycin was administered orally to rats and mice 3 days after birth. The studies design was 10M/10F animals in the dose groups, 20M/20F in the control group. The animals were dosed by gavage with a single dose of a suspension of clarithromycin in 5% gum arabic; control animals received a solution of 5% gum arabic. The recovery period was 14 days. Mice The mice were dosed at 714, 857, 1028, 1233, 1480 and 1776 mg/kg, the rats at 769, 1000, 1300, 1690, 2197 and 3713 mg/kg. LD50 (95% confidence limits) in mice was 1290 mg/kg (1170-1420 mg/kg) in males and 1230 mg/kg (1130-1340 mg/kg) in females; the sex difference was considered to be negligible. LD50 of clarithromycin orally administered to adult mice is about 2700 mg/kg; acute toxicity was more notable in juvenile animals than in adults. The LD50 of antibiotics of the penicillin group, cephalosporin group and macrolide group is generally lower in juvenile animals than in adults; clarithromycin showed similar results. Body weight was reduced or its increase was suppressed in both males and females of each dosing group from 1 to 4, 7 or 9 days after the administration, but its changes thereafter were comparable to those in the control group. Some animals died from 1 to 7 days after the administration. The general condition, suckling behaviour and spontaneous movements were depressed in some of the mice administered 1028 mg/kg or more clarithromycin from 1 day after the administration, but these changes disappeared by 7 days after the administration in those that survived the observation period. Necropsy of those that died spontaneously disclosed dark reddish lungs in more than half the animals. This finding suggests that the death in these animals was due to debilitation resulting from reduced suckling behaviour. In the survivors, necropsy showed dilation of renal pelvis in 1 male of the 1028 mg/kg group and hypoplasia of the kidney in 1 female of the 1233 mg/kg group, but these uncommon conditions are considered to be incidental. Rats LD50 (95% confidence limits) in rats was 1330 mg/kg (1210-1470 mg/kg) in males and 1270 mg/kg (1150-1400 mg/kg) in females, the sex difference was considered to be negligible. LD50 of the agent administered orally to adult rats is about 3000 mg/kg; the acute toxicity was more notable in juvenile animals than in adult animals. LD50 of antibiotics of the penicillin group, cephalosporin group, and macrolide group is generally lower in juvenile animals than in adult animals; clarithromycin showed similar results. - 82 - The body weight was reduced or its increase was suppressed in both males and females of each dosing group from 1 to 4 or 7 days after the administration, but body weight changes thereafter were comparable to those of the control group. Some of the animals of both sexes died from 2 to 5 days after the administration. The general condition, suckling behaviour and spontaneous movements were depressed in some animals from 1 or 2 days after the administration, but in survivors these changes disappeared by 13 days after the administration. In the control group, 1 male and female of the same litter showed depressed suckling behaviour and spontaneous movements from 13 days after the administration, and the female was cannibalised by its mother 14 days after the administration. This is considered to be due to the death of all the other animals of the litter and a resultant reduction in the nursing activity of the mother. Necropsy of those that died spontaneously showed dark-reddish lungs in about 25%. A reddish-black substance was noted in the intestines of a few males and females of each group administered 2197 mg/kg or more clarithromycin, probably because of bleeding from the intestines. From these findings, the deaths were considered to be due to debilitation resulting from depressed suckling behaviour or bleeding from the intestines. Necropsy of the survivors revealed nodulated ribs in 1 male of the control group. Since this animal showed a reduction in body weight from 11 days after the administration, these nodules are considered to have been caused by suppressed development of the ribs associated with a delay in the growth. White spots in the liver surface of the 769 mg/kg and 1300 mg/kg groups, and a bulging mass on the surface of the liver and adhesion of the liver to the diaphragm were observed in 1 female of the 769 mg/kg group. Since these changes were infrequent and were not observed in the animals that died during the observation period, they are considered to be incidental. Three clarithromycin pediatric formulations under consideration for development, a carbopol complex, a hot melt sprayed coating form and a spray-congealed dosage form, were evaluated for acute oral toxicity in rats. Five male and five females were administered a single oral dose of one of three clarithromycin pediatric formulations at a concentration of 250 mg/mL. The dose for all rats was 20 mL/kg (i.e., 5 g/kg). Except for one rat considered to have been misdosed with the spray congealed dosage form, none of the rats died and no signs of toxicity were observed. No gross morphologic changes were found when the rats were killed and necropsied two weeks after treatment. Doses greater than 5 g/kg were considered to be excessive (5 g/kg is generally employed as the highest test dose for test materials with toxicity too low to determine the minimum lethal dose). Thus, clarithromycin pediatric formulations were found to be non-toxic to rats at the applicable maximum dose of 5 g/kg. Subchronic Toxicity BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin film-coated tablets) - 83 - Studies were conducted in rats, dogs and monkeys with clarithromycin administered orally. The duration of administration ranged from 14 days to 42 days. Rat One study in rats (with oral doses up to 800 mg/kg/day) failed to show adverse effects in rats exposed to 50 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. The clinical signs observed at toxic doses were reduced motility, piloerection, hypothermia and perineal urine staining. Changes occurred in biochemical parameters at 200 and 800 mg/kg/day indicative of hepatotoxicity which was confirmed by histopathologic findings of hepatocyte necrosis. Other pathologic findings at the top two dose levels included swelling of the renal cortical tubular epithelia and atrophic changes to the lymphatic and genital systems. The same toxicity profile was observed in immature rats following the daily administration of oral doses up to 150 mg/kg/day of clarithromycin for 6 weeks. At 150 mg/kg/day, there was an increase in relative weights of liver and kidneys. Dog Dogs were dosed orally with 0, 6.25, 25, 100 or 400 mg/kg/day of clarithromycin daily for 28 days. Emesis occurred sporadically in the treated dogs. No other adverse effects were seen in dogs exposed to 6.25 mg/kg/day. The clinical signs at higher dosages included loose stools, lacrimation and conjunctivitis. Slight anorexia was noted in dogs receiving 100 mg/kg/day or more. Dogs at 400 mg/kg/day exhibited reduced red blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, serum albumin, and mean urine pH and specific gravity. Increases were seen in serum transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin concentrations. Bilirubin was detected in the urine. Other pathologic changes at 400 mg/kg/day included biliary hyperplasia, gastric glandular atrophy, renal tubule epithelial atrophy, edema of the iris, ciliary body and choroid, capillary proliferation in the cornea, suppression of spermatogenesis, and adrenal medullary degeneration. Monkey Monkeys were treated daily for one month with oral doses of 0, 25, 100 or 400 mg/kg/day. Two animals out of ten receiving 400 mg/kg/day died. Salivation was recorded at all dosage levels. No other adverse effects were seen in animals treated daily with 25 mg/kg/day. The clinical signs observed at higher doses and most frequently at 400 mg/kg/day were vomiting, emesis, sunken eyes, dehydration, emaciation, low rectal temperature, body weight loss, reduced food consumption, cloudiness of the cornea and reduction in intra-ocular pressure. Yellow discoloured feces were passed on a few isolated occasions by some animals given a dose of 400 mg/kg/day. As with the other species, the liver was the primary target at - 84 - toxic doses as shown by early elevation of serum concentration of glucose, BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, LDH, amylase and/or triglyceride; an electrolyte imbalance and low levels of protein, cholesterol, phospholipid; elevated leucine aminopeptidase (LAP). Principal histopathologic changes were seen mainly in high dose monkeys, but some mid-dose monkeys exhibited similar alterations. Changes included, necrosis and vacuolation of hepatocytes, vacuolation of renal cortical tubules, no spermatogenesis, thymic regression and single cell necrosis of the stomach. In man the recommended dose is 500 to 1000 mg/day or 7.1 - 14.3 mg/kg/day (70 kg person). BIAXIN® (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP) Rats Two-week toxicity study was done with clarithromycin granules administered orally to preweaning rats. Crl:CD*(SD)BR pups, 5 days old at the start of treatment, were dosed by oral gavage with suspension for 17 to 20 days. Treatment Group Test Material Dosagesa (mg/kg/day) Concentrationb (mg/mL) To T1 T2 T3 Vehiclec Clarithromycin Granule Clarithromycin Granule Clarithromycin Granule 0 15 55 200 0 2.46 9.02 32.79 a Dosages are expressed in terms of the free base b In terms of bulk granule (a potency of 610 :g/mg) c 0.2% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) No/Group M 10 10 10 10 F 10 10 10 10 One female pup in the vehicle Control group was found dead on day 18. Sporadic incidence of reddish spots on the skin or skin erythema occurred in some T3 pups. The mean weight gains from days 0 to 17 for T3 males and females were approximately 20 and 10% less than those of To males and females, respectively. There were no ophthalmic effects. Statistically significant decreases occurred in the values of mean hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin and mean cell volume of T3 male pups (200 mg/kg/day); T3 female pups (200 mg/kg/day) had lower hemoglobin and hematocrit values when compared to controls, but the differences were not significant; similarly the mean hematocrit value of the T3 male pups was also lower than that of the controls. A statistically significant increase was observed in the mean relative kidney weights of T3 pups when compared to controls. Treatment-related minimal to mild multifocal - 85 - vacuolar degeneration of the intrahepatic bile duct epithelium and an increased incidence of nephritic lesions were observed in the T3 pups (200 mg/kg/day). A dosage of 200 mg/ kg/day for two weeks produced decreased body weight gain, decreased mean hemoglobin and hematocrit values as well as histopathologic changes in the livers and kidneys of preweaning rats. The \"no-toxic-effect\" dosage in this two-week preweaning rat study was judged to be 55 mg/kg/day. This finding is similar to that reported following administration to adult rats for 1 month. Preweaning rats did not therefore appear to be more susceptible than mature rats. Crl:CD*(SD)BR immature rats, aged 15 days at the start of treatment, were dosed daily orally by gavage for 6 weeks. The rats were dosed at 0, 15, 50 and 150 mg/kg clarithromycin, with 10 male and 10 female animals allocated to each treatment group. The control group was treated with 0.2% HPMC vehicle only. No deaths occurred during the study. No drug-induced signs were observed. Male T3 pups had a consistently lower mean body weight than male To pups on the growth curves. This is considered to be a drug-related effect. Male T3 rats had lower mean food consumption than male To rats; male and female T2 rats appear to have consistently higher mean food consumption than male and female To rats (not statistically significant). The following increases in relative mean organ weights were observed: liver and kidney of male and female T3 rats, kidney of male T1 rats and spleen of female T3 rats. The increases in liver and kidney relative weights of male and female T3 rats were considered to be drug induced, but no concurrent drug- related micropathology was observed. Renal hydronephrosis occurred in one female T2 rat, which was not considered to be drug- related. A small number of microscopic alterations was distributed randomly through control and treatment groups. None were drug-related. The \"no-toxic effect\" level was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day. This finding is similar to administration of clarithromycin to adult rats for 1 month. Immature rats did not, therefore, appear to be more susceptible to clarithromycin than mature rats. Crl:CD*(SD)BR juvenile rats, 16 days old at the start of treatment, were dosed by oral gavage for 42 to 44 treatment days as follows: Treatment Group Test Material Dosagesa (mg/kg/day) Concentrationb (mg/mL) To T1 T2 Vehiclec Clarithromycin Granule for Suspension Clarithromycin Granule for Suspension 0 15 50 No/Group F M 10 10 10 10 0 2.44 8.13 10 10 - 86 - Dosagesa (mg/kg/day) 150 Concentrationb (mg/mL) 24.4 No/Group M F 10 10 Treatment Group Test Material T3 Clarithromycin Granule for Suspension a b c Dosages are expressed in terms of the free base In terms of bulk granule, Clarithromycin Granule for Suspension with a potency of 615 :g/mg. 0.2% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) There were no deaths in the study. Excessive salivation occurred in some T3 rats (1-2 hours after dosing) during the last three weeks of treatment. Male and female pups given 150 mg/kg/day (T3) consistently had lower mean body weights than controls throughout the treatment period. The differences were statistically significant during the first three weeks of treatment. The mean weight gains from days 0 to 40 for T3 males and females were 9.4 and 6.9% less than those of To males and females, respectively. There were no significant differences between control and drug-treatment groups in food consumption. There were no treatment-related ophthalmic effects. No meaningful differences were found in urinalyses and hematology parameters for the drug- treated and control rats. There was a statistically significant decrease in the mean albumin values of T3 male and female rats when compared to controls and a statistically significant increase in the mean relative liver weights for T3 rats when compared to controls. No treatment-related gross or microscopic observations were found. A dosage of 150 mg/kg/day produced slight toxicity in the treated rats. Therefore the no-effect dosage was judged to be 50 mg/kg/day. Wistar rats, 4 days old at the start of treatment were dosed by oral gavage for 28 treatment days followed by a 28-day recovery period. Treatment was as follows: Treatment Group Test Material Dosagesa (mg/kg/day) No/Group M F To T1 T2 T3 Vehicleb Clarithromycin Clarithromycin Clarithromycin 0 12.5 50 200 20 12 20 20 20 12 20 20 a b Dosages are expressed in terms of the free base 5% Gum Arabic - 87 - No deaths or abnormalities in the general condition of the animals occurred during the administration or recovery periods in all treated groups. Body weight gain was suppressed in males and females of the 200 mg/kg group from the 4th day of administration; but normal body weight gain was restored by the discontinuation of the administration. Urinalysis showed slight elevation in pH of the groups administered 50 mg/kg or more clarithromycin, but it was normalized after discontinuation of the administration. Hematological examinations showed a reduction in haematocrit and a reduction in hemoglobin in both sexes, a reduction in MCHC in males, and a reduction in MCH in females of the 200 mg/kg group. Platelets were reduced in males of the 200 mg/kg group and females of all dosing groups, and white blood cells were reduced in both sexes of the 200 mg/kg group. These changes, however, were reversed or reduced by discontinuation of the administration. Serum biochemical analyses revealed reduction in AST, ALP, total protein, and albumin in both sexes, a reduction in the calcium level in males, and an elevation in the blood glucose level and reduction in the creatinine level in females of the 200 mg/kg group. These changes, however, could be reversed by discontinuation of the administration. Necropsy revealed no abnormalities in any of the groups. Concerning organ weights, the absolute and relative weights of the thymus were reduced in males and females of the 200 mg/kg group, but normal weights were restored by discontinuation of the administration. Changes considered to be related to suppression of body weight gains were observed in the brain, lungs, heart (males only), liver, spleen, kidneys, caecum, and testes (males only) in both sexes of the 200 mg/kg/group. The weight of these organs recovered after discontinuation of the administration. Histopathological studies showed no changes considered to be related to the administration of clarithromycin. Dogs Clarithromycin was administered to juvenile beagles by oral catheter daily for four weeks at doses of 0 (Control), 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg, followed by a 4-week withdrawal period to evaluate recovery. At the start of the study the beagles were 3 weeks old; each group consisted of 3 males and 3 females; and 1 female and male were added to the control and high-dose groups for the recovery study. None of the animals died during the administration or recovery period, and no changes in the general condition of the animals were observed. No changes considered to be due to the administration of clarithromycin were observed in the food consumption, body weight, or the results of ophthalmological, hematological, or serum biochemical examinations. Urinalysis indicated very slight occult blood in one female of the high-dose (300 mg/kg) group at the end of the administration period, but it was considered to be unrelated to the administration. Pathological examinations showed dose-associated reductions in the relative weight of the kidneys in females, but these changes were considered to be unrelated to the administration, because individual values were not abnormal. Necropsy revealed no abnormalities. During histological examination, fatty deposition of centrilobular hepatocytes and cell infiltration of - 88 - portal areas was observed by the light microscopy, and an increase in hepatocellular fat droplets was noted by electron microscopy in the 300 mg/kg group. In this group, also, increased fat deposition was noted relatively frequently in the kidneys. Other findings, which were considered to be unrelated to the administration, included congestion and megakaryocytic proliferation in the spleen, regional atelectasis and localised lesions of pneumonia in the lungs, leukocytic infiltration around the intrapulmonary bronchi, microfollicular formation of the thyroid glands and reduced stainability (degeneration) of Purkinje's cells. From these findings, the no-effect dose of clarithromycin in a 4-week subacute oral toxicity and a 4-week recovery study in juvenile beagles was considered to be 100 mg/kg for both males and females. The toxic dose was considered to be above 300 mg/kg. Chronic Toxicity BIAXIN BID* (clarithromycin film-coated tablets) Rats (20/sex/group) were treated daily with oral doses of 0, 15, 37.5, 75 or 150 mg/kg/day for three months. There were eight incidental deaths, but none of them were considered treatment related. Clinical signs included increased salivation, dehydration, hyperactivity and were observed in a dose-related manner. The only toxic effect noted, was some variation in body weight gain. No toxicologically significant changes occurred in hematology, biochemistry or urinalysis results. Post mortem, there was an increase in mean relative liver and kidney weights at the top dose level. No microscopic changes were detected in the kidneys, but in the liver, there was a sex/dose-related increase in multinucleated hepatocytes. Effects were only seen in females at 150 mg/kg/day but in males occurred as low as 37.5 mg/kg/day. A six-month oral study was performed in rats (20-27/sex/group) at dosages of 0, 1-6, 8, 40 or 200 mg/kg/ day. Seven male and female rats from the control group and the 40 and 200 mg/kg/day groups were allowed a 63-day non-dosed recovery period. No mortalities occurred. Body weight and food intake were reduced at high doses during the dosing phase but normalized during recovery. Water intake and urine volume increased in males and females of the 40 and 200 mg/ kg/day groups. Dose-related hematological changes included reduced erythrocytes and HCT with increased MCV, MCH and MCHC and relative eosinophil counts. Biochemical changes were mainly restricted to the high dose group and included increased ALP and decreased phospholipids; decreased total cholesterol and triglycerides, and increased AST and ALT in males only and decreased albumin in females only. - 89 - found to increases were Organ weight liver, and spleen. Histopathological examinations showed drug-related, recovery-reversible, increases in multi- nucleated hepatocytes associated with minimal and focal necrosis in livers of both sexes at the top two dose levels. No relevant pathology was found in the cecum, adrenals or spleen to account for the increased weights. After recovery only the 200 mg/kg/day group had increased multinucleated hepatocytes. include cecum, adrenals, Dogs (7/sex/group) were administered daily with oral doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day of clarithromycin for three months. Emesis occurred at levels of 30 mg/kg and above. One male high dose dog was killed in extremis on day 69. Drug-related lesions were seen in the liver, gall bladder, thymus and stomach. Hematological and biochemical changes at the high dose level included, decreased RBC and HCT, increased ALT, ALP, GGT, and decreased total protein and albumin. No significant organ weight changes were recorded, but treatment-related microscopic alterations in the liver and stomach of mild and high dose dogs were seen, as well as changes in gall bladder, spleen and thymus of high dose animals. A six month oral study was also performed in dogs (4-5/sex/group) at dosages of 0, 0.8, 4, 20 or 100 mg/kg/day. At the 0 and 100 mg/kg levels, one male and one female dog were allowed a one-month, non-dosed, recovery period. One male high dose dog died on day 174. This death was considered to be as a direct result of clarithromycin administration. Histopathologic examination revealed hepatic parenchymal damage, identifying the cause of clinical jaundice. Clinical signs during the dosing phase of the study were restricted to the top two dose levels and included emesis and ocular signs. Food consumption and water intake were reduced at 20 and 100 mg/kg/day. Hematologic changes at 100 mg/kg were indicative of subclinical anemia. Biochemical alter- ations at the same level were associated with liver damage. Ocular changes were only apparent at the top dose level. Increase in the weights of lung, liver, spleen, adrenals and kidneys were found at 100 mg/kg/day. Histopathologic examination of these organs showed degeneration of liver parenchyma, and toxic effects in adrenals. The thymus weight was reduced at 100 mg/kg/day. At the end of the recovery period all findings had regressed or reduced. Monkeys (5-6/sex/group) were similarly administered clarithromycin at levels of 0, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day for six months. At the 0 and 100 mg/kg levels, one male and one female monkey were allowed a one-month recovery period. One high dose female died in week 25. Inhalation of vomit was considered to be the cause of death. Clinical signs were restricted to a dose-related incidence of emesis and salivation. No treatment-related effects were found in food consumption, ophthalmoscopy or hematology. Weight loss was restricted to one high dose female. Minor serum chemistry changes were seen at the 100 mg/kg level, particularly in plasma proteins. Urinalysis revealed a dose-related lowering of pH and SG at 13 weeks only. Organ weight increases in liver, adrenal and kidneys were seen at high doses, but pathology was restricted to minimal liver changes consisting of cytoplasmic rarefaction of centrilobular hepatocytes. All changes were reversed during the recovery period. Carcinogenicity - 90 - Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of clarithromycin. Mutagenicity following in vitro mutagenicity tests have been conducted with clarithromycin: The Salmonella/mammalian microsome test, bacterial induced mutation frequency test, in vitro chromosome aberration test, rat hepatocyte DNA synthesis assay, mouse lymphoma assay, mouse dominant lethal study, mouse micronucleus test. All tests had negative results except the in vitro chromosome aberration test which was weakly positive in one test and negative in another. In addition, a Bacterial Reverse-Mutation Test (Ames Test) has been performed on clarithromycin metabolites with negative results. Reproduction and Teratology Fertility and reproduction studies have shown that daily doses of 150-160 mg/kg/day to male and female rats caused no adverse effects on the estrous cycle, fertility, parturition, or number and viability of offspring. Plasma levels in rats after 150 mg/kg/day were 2 times the human serum levels. In the 150 mg/kg/day monkey studies, plasma levels were 3 times the human serum levels. When given orally after 150 mg/kg/day, clarithromycin was shown to produce embryonic loss in monkeys. This effect has been attributed to marked maternal toxicity of the drug at this high dose. In rabbits, in utero fetal loss occurred at an intravenous dose of 33 mg/ sq m, which is 17 times less than the maximum proposed human oral daily dose of 618 mg/sq m. Special Studies Acute Renal Toxicity: There was no evidence of nephrotoxicity of clarithromycin in the rat at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day. Hepatotoxicity: In the in vitro and in vivo hepatotoxicity studies comparing clarithromycin with erythromycin, it was found that clarithromycin caused no greater cytotoxicity than erythromycin stearate and much less toxicity than erythromycin estolate. Hepatic enzyme induction was not found in doses below 500 mg/kg/day. In cynomolgus monkeys, the closest metabolic model for humans, elevations of ALT and LDH were identified at 200 mg/kg/day. In dogs, a rise of ALT has been seen at 100 mg/kg/day, and in Wistar rats, a similar elevation of enzymes was seen at 200 mg/kg/day. Morphologic lesions related to prolonged exposure to clarithromycin (up to 6 months) have been consistent with reportedly reversible changes in rat, dog, and monkey studies. Such doses are many times beyond the therapeutic range in humans, which is within 8-10 mg/kg/day. Ocular Toxicity - 91 - Ocular lesions appear confined to dogs and monkeys receiving lethal doses, which were large multiples of the human therapeutic dose. Radiolabelled clarithromycin studies indicate the eye is not selectively burdened by drug deposits and that clearance from this tissue follows that seen in other tissues. Opacities occur in the cornea following widespread extraocular tissue changes which are detectable via numerous diagnostic methods. Reduced intraocular pressure precedes corneal opacity in a relatively predictive manner. Some evidence for transient opacity and at least partial resolution was noted in animal studies, but most animals succumbed to other organ dysfunctions shortly after opacities were observed. Animals given doses close to the therapeutic dose had no ocular changes. No ophthalmologic effects were noted in rabbits treated at doses of 40 and 160 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Ototoxicity No effects on pinna reflex were seen in guinea pigs at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day but inner and outer hair cells disappeared suggesting toxic damage. No evidence of damage was reported at 200 mg/kg/day. - 92 - REFERENCES 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Barry AL, Thornsberry C, Jones RN.

Salmeterol offers more effective protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction and produces a longer duration of bronchodilation, lasting for at least 12 hours, than recommended doses of conventional short-acting $2-agonists. In contrast to conventional short-acting $2-agonists, the onset of the bronchodilator effect of salmeterol usually occurs in 10-20 minutes. However, the full benefits only become apparent after the first or second dose of the drug. Regular dosing produces sustained improvement in lung function thereby reducing symptoms of airways obstruction. In vitro tests on human lung, have shown salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 2 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. and prostaglandin D2. In man, salmeterol inhibits the early and late phase response to inhaled allergen. The late phase response is inhibited for over 30 hours after a single dose, when the bronchodilator effect is no longer evident. The full clinical significance of these findings is not yet clear. The mechanism is different from the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids. Pharmacokinetics: Salmeterol acts locally in the lung; plasma levels therefore do not predict therapeutic effect. Because of the low therapeutic dose, systemic levels of salmeterol are low or undetectable after inhalation of recommended doses (50 mcg twice daily). Salmeterol is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism; liver function impairment may lead to accumulation of salmeterol in plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 3 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Asthma Indications and Clinical Use SEREVENT® (salmeterol xinafoate) is indicated for long-term, twice-daily (morning and evening) administration in the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 4 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease, including patients with nocturnal asthma, who are using optimal corticosteroid treatment and experiencing breakthrough symptoms requiring regular use of a short-acting bronchodilator. It should not be used in patients whose asthma can be managed by occasional use of short-acting, inhaled $2-agonists. Corticosteroids should not be stopped because salmeterol is prescribed. SEREVENT® is a slow onset, long-acting, $2-agonist and should not be used as a rescue medication. To relieve acute asthmatic symptoms, a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) should be used. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) SEREVENT® is indicated for long term, twice daily (morning and evening) administration in the maintenance treatment of bronchospasm and relief of dyspnea associated with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Contraindications SEREVENT® (salmeterol xinafoate) is contraindicated in patients with cardiac tachyarrhythmias and in those with a known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the preparations and to adrenergic compounds. SEREVENT® inhalation aerosol formulation contains soya lecithin and is contraindicated in patients with an allergy to lecithin, soya or related food products such as soybeans (see PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION, Composition). SEREVENT® dry powder for inhalation (SEREVENT® DISKHALER® Disk and SEREVENT® DISKUS® formulations contain lactose (which contains milk protein) DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 4 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (see PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION, Composition) and are contraindicated in patients with an allergy to lactose, milk or in those who have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to salmeterol xinafoate. Warnings USE IN ASTHMA (see also General Warnings for Asthma and COPD) IMPORTANT INFORMATION: 1. SEREVENT® (salmeterol xinafoate) should not be initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma, which may be a life-threatening condition (see PRECAUTIONS). Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported worldwide, when SEREVENT® has been initiated in this situation. Although it is not possible from these reports to determine whether SEREVENT® contributed to these events or simply failed to relieve the deteriorating asthma, the use of SEREVENT® in this setting is inappropriate. 2. SEREVENT® is not a substitute for inhaled or oral corticosteriods: In asthma, corticosteroids should not be stopped or reduced when SEREVENT® is initiated (see PRECAUTIONS, Use in Asthma). The Role of Long-Acting $2-Agonist in the Management of Asthma: 3. The management of asthma should normally follow a stepwise programme, and patient response should be monitored clinically and by lung function tests. Sudden or progressive deterioration is potentially life-threatening; treatment plan must be re-evaluated, and consideration be given to increasing corticosteroid therapy. In patients at risk, daily peak flow monitoring with precise instructions for acceptable variation limits should be considered. in asthma control Increased use of inhaled, short-acting $2-agonists is a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires re-evaluation of the patient and consideration of alternative treatment regimens, especially inhaled or systemic corticosteroids. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 5 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Long-acting $2-agonists are an alternative additional therapy for patients with moderate asthma with unsatisfactory symptom control despite an optimal dose of inhaled steroids particularly when there are nocturnal symptoms. Before introducing long-acting $2-agonists, adequate education should be provided to the patient on how to use the drug and what to do if asthma flares up. Use With Short-Acting $2-Agonists: When asthmatic patients begin 4. treatment with SEREVENT®, those who have been taking short-acting, inhaled $2-agonists on a regular daily basis should be advised to discontinue their regular daily-dosing regimen and should be clearly instructed to use short-acting, inhaled $2-agonists only for symptomatic relief if they develop asthma symptoms while taking SEREVENT® (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). USE IN COPD (see also General Warnings for Asthma and COPD) 1. The Role of Long-Acting $2-Agonist in the Management of COPD: The aims of COPD bronchodilator therapy are to alleviate symptoms, to improve performance of activities of day-to-day living and to enhance quality of life. Long-acting $2-agonists are an additional therapy for patients requiring long acting control of symptoms. 2. Corticosteroids in COPD: In the treatment of COPD, the role of inhaled corticosteroid therapy is less well established and SEREVENT® could be used with or without concomitant corticosteroids. The use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids in COPD patients should be considered only if a response to corticosteroids has been clearly documented. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 6 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. GENERAL WARNINGS FOR ASTHMA AND COPD 1. SEREVENT® should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms: It is crucial to inform patients of this and prescribe a short-acting, inhaled $2-agonist for this purpose (see PRECAUTIONS). Cardiovascular Effects: Although clinically not significant, a small 2. increase in QTc intervals have been reported at therapeutic doses. It is not known if this becomes clinically significant when concomitant medications causing similar effects are prescribed and/or in the presence of heart diseases, hypokalemia, or hypoxia. In a very large scale Post-marketing Surveillance study in the UK, involving over twenty-four thousand patients comparing safety of salmeterol and salbutamol in the treatment of asthma, the overall cardiovascular deaths on salmeterol treatment were 0.17% vs. 0.12% on salbutamol (p=0.308). The subdivision of these deaths into groups dependent on asthma severity were as follows: Investigator Assessment of Severity of Asthma Mild (%) Moderate (%) Severe (%) Salmeterol Salbutamol Test for Interaction p = 0.233 0.04 0.14 0.11 0.07 0.55 0.27 Fatalities have been reported following excessive use of aerosol preparations containing sympathomimetic amines, the exact cause of which is unknown. Cardiac arrest was reported in several instances. In individual patients any $2-adrenergic agonist may have a clinically significant cardiac effect. Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhaled medications, 3. paradoxical bronchospasm (which can be life threatening) has been reported following the use of SEREVENT® inhalation aerosol. If it occurs, treatment with SEREVENT® inhalation aerosol should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 7 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity 4. reactions may occur after administration of SEREVENT®, as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash and bronchospasm. 5. Upper Airway Symptoms: Symptoms of laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling, such as stridor and choking, have been reported rarely in patients receiving SEREVENT®. Others: In common with other $-adrenergic agents, salmeterol can induce 6. reversible metabolic changes (e.g. hyperglycemia, hypokalemia). $-adrenergic blocking drugs, especially the non-cardioselective ones, may effectively antagonise the action of salmeterol. The safety of salmeterol in pregnancy and lactation has not been established (see also PRECAUTIONS, Use in Women). Precautions USE IN ASTHMA (see also General Precautions for Asthma and COPD) Do Not 1. Introduce SEREVENT® as a Treatment for Acutely Deteriorating Asthma: SEREVENT® (salmeterol xinafoate) is intended for the maintenance treatment of asthma (see INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE) and should not be introduced in acutely deteriorating asthma, which is a potentially life threatening condition. There are no data demonstrating that SEREVENT® provides greater efficacy than or additional efficacy to short-acting, inhaled $2-agonists in patients with worsening asthma. Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported worldwide in patients receiving SEREVENT®. In most cases these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, or previous life-threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and/or in some patients in whom asthma has been acutely deteriorating (e.g., unresponsive to usual medications, increasing need for inhaled short-acting $2-agonists, increasing need for systemic DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 8 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. corticosteroids, significant increase in symptoms, recent emergency room visits, sudden or progressive deterioration in pulmonary function). However, they have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. It was not possible from these reports to determine whether SEREVENT® contributed to these events or simply failed to relieve the deteriorating asthma. Watch for Increasing Use of Short-Acting, Inhaled $2-Agonists, Which 2. is a Marker of Deteriorating Asthma: Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient’s short-acting inhaled $2-agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalation than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma. In this setting, the patient requires immediate re-evaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen. Increasing the daily dosage of SEREVENT® in this situation is not appropriate. SEREVENT® should not be used more frequently than twice daily (morning and evening) at the recommended dose. Do Not Use SEREVENT® as a Substitute for Oral or Inhaled 3. Corticosteroids: There are no data demonstrating that SEREVENT® has a clinical anti-inflammatory effect and could be expected to take the place of, or reduce the dose of, corticosteroids. Asthmatic patients must be warned not to stop or reduce corticosteroid therapy even if they feel better as a result of initiating SEREVENT®. Any change in corticosteroid dosage should be made ONLY after clinical evaluation (see PRECAUTIONS, Information to be Provided to the Patient). Use in Adolescents/Children and Asthma Severity Reassessment: In 4. adolescents and children, the severity of asthma may be variable with age and periodic reassessment should be considered to determine if continued maintenance therapy with SEREVENT® is still indicated. Compliance, especially neglect of anti-inflammatory therapy and overuse of short-acting $2-agonists, should be carefully followed in adolescents/children receiving long-acting $2-agonists. GENERAL PRECAUTIONS FOR ASTHMA AND COPD 1. Do Not Use SEREVENT® To Treat Acute Symptoms of Asthma: A DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 9 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. short-acting, inhaled $2-agonist, not SEREVENT®, should be used to relieve acute asthma symptoms. When prescribing SEREVENT®, the physician must also provide the patient with a short-acting, inhaled $2-agonist (e.g., salbutamol) for treatment of symptoms that occur acutely, despite regular twice daily (morning and evening) use of SEREVENT®. 2. Do Not Exceed Recommended Dosage: As with other inhaled $2-adrenergic drugs, SEREVENT® should not be used more often or at higher doses than recommended. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiovascular and Other Effects: No clinically significant effect on the 3. cardiovascular system is usually seen after the administration of inhaled salmeterol in recommended doses, but the cardiovascular and central nervous system effects seen with all sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., increased blood pressure, heart rate, excitement) can occur after use of SEREVENT® and may require discontinuation of the drug. Salmeterol, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension; in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. As has been described with other $-adrenergic agonist bronchodilators, clinically significant changes in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and electrocardiograms have been seen infrequently in individual patients in controlled clinical studies with salmeterol. 4. Metabolic Effects: Doses of the related $2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. Administration of $2-adrenoceptor agonists may cause a decrease in serum potassium, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to increase the likelihood DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 10 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. of arrythmias. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Clinically significant changes in blood glucose and/or serum potassium were seen rarely during clinical studies with long-term administration of SEREVENT® at recommended doses. 5. Drug Interactions Short-Acting $-Agonists: Aerosol bronchodilators of the short-acting adrenergic stimulant type may be used for relief of breakthrough symptoms while using salmeterol for asthma. But increasing use of such preparations to control symptoms indicates deterioration of asthma control and the patient's therapy plan should be reassessed. The regular, concomitant use of salmeterol and other sympathomimetic agents is not recommended, since such combined use may lead to deleterious cardiovascular effects. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants: Salmeterol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 week of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of salmeterol on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents. Corticosteroids and Cromoglycate: In clinical trials, inhaled corticosteroids and/or inhaled cromolyn sodium did not alter the safety profile of SEREVENT® when administered concurrently. Ipratropium Bromide: In COPD trials, ipratropium bromide did not alter the safety profile of SEREVENT® when administered concurrently. Methylxanthines: The concurrent use of intravenously or orally administered methylxanthines (e.g., aminophylline, theophylline) by patients receiving SEREVENT® has not been completely evaluated. $-blocking drugs: Non-selective $-blocking drugs should never be prescribed in combination with salmeterol since they may antagonise the bronchodilating action of salmeterol. Cardioselective $-blocking drugs should be used with DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 11 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. caution in patients using medications for bronchodilation. Other Drugs: Use with caution in patients receiving other medications causing hypokalemia and/or increased QTc interval (diuretics, high dose steroids, anti-arrhythmics, astemizole, terfenadine) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic anti-depressants, since cardiac and vascular effects may be potentiated. 6. Use in Women Pregnant Women: In animal studies, some effects on the foetus, typical for a $-agonist occurred at exposure levels substantially higher than those that occur with therapeutic use. Extensive use of other $-agonists has provided no evidence that effects in animals are relevant to human use. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with SEREVENT® in pregnant women. SEREVENT® should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Use in Labour and Delivery: There are no well-controlled human studies that have investigated effects of salmeterol on preterm labor or labor at term. Because of the potential for $-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of SEREVENT® during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Lactating Women: Plasma levels of salmeterol after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low (85 to 200 pg/mL) in humans and therefore levels in milk should be correspondingly low. Studies in lactating animals indicate that salmeterol is likely to be secreted in only very small amounts in breast milk. However, since there is no experience with use of SEREVENT® by nursing mothers, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Caution should be exercised when salmeterol xinafoate is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: The safety and efficacy of SEREVENT® in children 7. younger than 4 years of age have not been established. The safety and efficacy of salmeterol in children 4-11 years old with asthma has been evaluated in controlled clinical trials for up to 1 year. Based on available DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 12 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. data, no adjustment of salmeterol dosage in pediatric patients is warranted (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Geriatric Use: No apparent differences in the efficacy and safety of 8. SEREVENT® were observed when geriatric patients were compared with younger patients in asthma and COPD clinical trials. As with other $2-agonists, however, special caution should be observed when using SEREVENT® in elderly patients who have concomitant cardiovascular disease that could be adversely affected by this class of drug. Based on available data, no adjustment of salmeterol dosage in geriatric patients is warranted. Proper Inhaler Technique: Patients' inhaler technique should be 9. checked to make sure that aerosol actuation is synchronized with inspiration of breath for optimum delivery of the drug to the lungs. to be Provided to Information the Patient: See 10. illustrated INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT section for the type of inhaler that is being prescribed. It is important that patients be instructed on how to use the SEREVENT® inhalation device correctly and how it should be used in relation to other asthma or COPD medications they are taking. Patients should be given the following information: i) The physician should be notified immediately if any of the following situations occur, which may be a sign of seriously worsening asthma: - Decreased effectiveness of short-acting, inhaled $2-agonists for relief of asthma symptoms. - Need for more inhalations than usual of short-acting, inhaled $2-agonists for relief of asthma symptoms. ii) The parents/guardians of adolescents/children who have been prescribed SEREVENT® should be alerted to the general concern regarding asthma therapy compliance, especially neglect of anti-inflammatory therapy and overuse of short-acting $2-agonists. iii) Patients should not stop SEREVENT® therapy for COPD without physician guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 13 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. iv) v) vi) vii) viii) ix) Asthmatic and COPD patients should be encouraged to stop smoking. An annual influenza vaccination should also be considered for patients with significant respiratory disease. The recommended dosage should not be exceeded. SEREVENT® should not be used as a substitute for oral or inhaled corticosteroids. The dosage of these medications should not be stopped or reduced without consulting the physician, even if the patient feels better after initiating treatment with SEREVENT®. Patients should be cautioned cardiovascular effects, such as palpitations or chest pain. regarding potential adverse In patients receiving SEREVENT®, other inhaled medications should be used only as directed by the physician. SEREVENT® is not meant to relieve acute asthma or COPD symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with a short-acting, inhaled $2-agonist such as salbutamol for asthma (the physician should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used). DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 14 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions to salmeterol are similar in nature to reactions to other selective $2-adrenoceptor agonists, i.e. palpitation; immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, edema and angioedema; headache; tremor; nervousness and paradoxical bronchospasm. There have also been reports of oropharyngeal irritation, arthralgia and muscle cramps. Cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles) have been reported, usually in susceptible patients. Asthma Use in adolescents and adults In controlled, multidose clinical trials involving almost 2000 patients, the most frequently occurring adverse events were headache, tremor and palpitations, which are pharmacologically predictable effects of $2-adrenoceptor agonists. Tremor tended to be transient, dose-related and reduced with regular therapy. Headache and palpitations were reported but the incidence was not significantly different from placebo.

A short acting inhaled $2- adrenergic drug was also provided to all patients for use on an as-needed basis. The incidence of pharmacologically predictable adverse events was similar in all groups except for tremor which was significantly higher in the salmeterol 100mcg group compared with the other two groups.

If it occurs, the preparation should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. In US clinical trials, other events occurring in the SEREVENT® (salmeterol xinafoate) treatment group at a frequency of 1% to 3% were rhinitis, laryngitis, nausea, viral gastroenteritis, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, urticaria, dental pain, pain in joint, back pain, muscle cramp/contraction, myalgia/myositis, muscular soreness, nervousness, malaise/fatigue, tracheitis/bronchitis, rash/skin eruption, and dysmenorrhea. In small dose-response studies, tremor, nervousness, and palpitations appeared to be dose related. Use in children Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies have compared twice daily administration of SEREVENT® 25mcg and 50mcg versus salbutamol in patients aged 4 to 16 years with asthma. Adverse events that occurred with an incidence of $3 in the salmeterol groups, irrespective of the relationship to treatment, are summarized below.

There was no evidence to suggest that children of a younger age were more at risk than those in the older age groups. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 17 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Postmarketing experience In extensive worldwide postmarketing experience, serious exacerbations of asthma, including some that have been fatal, have been reported. In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma and/or in some patients in whom asthma has been acutely deteriorating (see WARNINGS), but they have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. It was not possible from these reports to determine whether SEREVENT® contributed to these events or simply failed to relieve the deteriorating asthma. Postmarketing experience includes rare reports of upper airway symptoms of laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling, such as stridor and choking. Hypertension and arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles) have been reported. Because these events are voluntarily reported from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. COPD Two multicenter, 12 week, controlled studies have evaluated twice daily doses of SEREVENT® inhalation aerosol in patients with COPD. In clinical trials, SEREVENT® was generally well tolerated over chronic dosing periods. The most frequently reported adverse events with SEREVENT® 50 mcg twice daily were headache, upper respiratory tract infection and sore throat. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 18 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. The following table reports the incidence of adverse events in these two studies.

Common cold, rhinorrhea, bronchitis, cough, exacerbation of chest congestion, chest pain, and dizziness occurred at 3% or more but were equally common on placebo. Other events occurring in the SEREVENT® inhalation aerosol treatment group at a frequency of 1% to 3% were cold symptoms, earache, epistaxis, nasal congestion, nasal sinus congestion, sneezing, nausea, dyspepsia, gastric pain, gastric upset, abdominal pain, constipation, heartburn, oral candidiasis, xerostomia, vomiting, surgical removal of tooth, leg cramps, myalgia, neck pain, pain in arm, shoulder pain, muscle injury of neck, insomnia, sinus headache, fatigue, fever, pain in body, discomfort in chest, acute bronchitis, dyspnea, influenza, lower respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 19 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. shortness of breath, urinary tract infection. Electrocardiographic Monitoring in Patients With COPD: Continuous electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring was performed on 284 patients in two large COPD clinical trials during five 24 hour periods. No significant increase in the incidence of ventricular and supraventricular ectopic events was observed between SEREVENT® and placebo. No cases of sustained ventricular tachycardia were observed. At baseline, non-sustained, asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia was recorded for 7 (7.1%), 8 (9.4%), and 3 (3.0%) patients in the placebo, SEREVENT®, and ipratropium groups, respectively. During treatment, non-sustained, asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia that represented a clinically significant change from baseline was reported for 11 (11.6%), 15 (18.3%), and 20 (20.8%) patients receiving placebo, SEREVENT®, and ipratropium, respectively. Four of these cases of ventricular tachycardia were reported as adverse events (1 placebo, 3 SEREVENT®) by one investigator based upon review of Holter data. One case of ventricular tachycardia was observed during ECG evaluation of chest pain (ipratropium) and reported as an adverse event. Symptoms and Treatment of Overdosage Overdosage of $2-agonists may cause tremor, headache and tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, hypokalemia, hypertension and, in extreme cases, sudden death. Treatment should be symptomatic; cardiac and respiratory function should be monitored and support provided if necessary. The preferred antidote for overdosage with salmeterol is the judicious use of a cardioselective $-blocking agent. Cardioselective $-blocking drugs should be used with caution, bearing in mind the danger of inducing an asthmatic attack. Serum potassium level should be monitored. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 20 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Asthma Dosage and Administration SEREVENT® (salmeterol xinafoate) should not be initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma, which may be a life-threatening condition (see PRECAUTIONS). SEREVENT® is not a replacement for inhaled or oral corticosteroid therapy; its use is complementary to it. Patients must be warned not to stop or reduce anti-inflammatory therapy without medical advice, even if they feel better on SEREVENT®. SEREVENT® should not be used to treat acute symptoms. It is crucial to inform patients of this and prescribe a short-acting $2-agonist for this purpose. The need for additional symptomatic bronchodilator therapy is usually reduced with SEREVENT® (see WARNINGS, Use in Asthma). Medical attention should be sought if patients find that short-acting relief bronchodilator treatment becomes less effective or if they need more inhalations than usual. Bronchodilators should not be the only or the main treatment in patients with moderate to severe or unstable asthma. Patients with severe asthma require regular medical assessment since death may occur. These patients will require high dose inhaled or oral corticosteroid therapy. Sudden worsening of symptoms may require increased corticosteroids dosage which should be administered under medical supervision. As twice-daily regular treatment, SEREVENT® provides twenty-four hour bronchodilation and can replace regular use of a fast-acting, short duration (4 hour) inhaled or oral bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) when optimum corticosteroid therapy is being used. Maintenance Therapy DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 21 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. SEREVENT® Inhalation Aerosol: Patients 4 years of age and older: Two inhalations [2 x 25 micrograms of salmeterol (as the xinafoate)] twice daily. SEREVENT® DISKHALER® Disk: SEREVENT® DISKHALER® Disks are for use with a SEREVENT® DISKHALER® device only. Patients 4 years of age and older: One blister [50 micrograms of salmeterol (as the xinafoate)] twice daily. SEREVENT® DISKUS® : Patients 4 years of age and older: One blister [50 micrograms of salmeterol (as the xinafoate)] twice daily. Adolescents/Children: In adolescents/children the severity of asthma may be variable with age and periodic reassessment should be considered to determine if continued maintenance therapy with SEREVENT® is still indicated (see PRECAUTIONS). For full therapeutic benefit, regular usage of SEREVENT® is recommended in the treatment of reversible airways obstruction. COPD Counselling on smoking cessation should be the first step in treating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking cessation produces symptomatic benefits and has been shown to confer a survival advantage by slowing or stopping the progression of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. For maintenance treatment of bronchospasm and relief of dyspnea associated with COPD (including chronic bronchitis and emphysema), the usual dosage is 50 micrograms of salmeterol (as the xinafoate) twice daily. SEREVENT® Inhalation Aerosol: Two inhalations [2 x 25 micrograms of salmeterol (as the xinafoate)] twice daily. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 22 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. SEREVENT® DISKHALER® Disk: One blister [50 micrograms of salmeterol (as the xinafoate)] twice daily. SEREVENT® DISKUS®: One blister [50 micrograms of salmeterol (as the xinafoate)] twice daily. General Considerations for Asthma and COPD The dosage or frequency of SEREVENT® administration should not be increased since there may be serious adverse effects associated with excessive dosing. SEREVENT® is administered by the inhaled route only. Children: At present, there are insufficient clinical data to recommend the use of salmeterol xinafoate in children younger than 4 years of age. Elderly and patients with impaired renal function: There is no need to adjust the dose in the otherwise healthy elderly or in patients with impaired renal function (see PRECAUTIONS). Because salmeterol is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. SEREVENT® SHOULD NOT BE USED MORE THAN TWICE DAILY.

Information for the Patient SEREVENT® Inhalation Aerosol PLEASE READ THIS LEAFLET CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE. For further information or advice, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How Your Medicine Works SEREVENT® Inhalation Aerosol Should Be Used ONLY Twice a Day SEREVENT® Inhalation Aerosol Should NOT Be Used as Relief Medication SEREVENT® (salmeterol xinafoate) is one of a group of medicines called bronchodilators. It works by relieving spasm or narrowing in the small air passages in the lungs causing chest tightness and wheezing. This helps to open up the airways and makes it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. The effects of salmeterol xinafoate last for at least 12 hours. When it is taken regularly, it helps the small air passages to stay open. SEREVENT® is used to help breathing problems in asthma and other chest illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is very important that you use SEREVENT® twice a day, in the morning and again in the evening. This will help protect you against breakthrough symptoms throughout the day and during the night. YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT MORE THAN TWICE A DAY. SEREVENT® does not replace your fast-acting asthma relief medication (e.g. VENTOLIN® salbutamol) or inhaled anti-inflammatory therapy (e.g. beclomethasone dipropionate or FLOVENT®, fluticasone propionate). Its overuse can be serious. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 28 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. SEREVENT® does NOT act quickly enough to be used as a relief medication. SEREVENT® should NOT be used to provide relief for a sudden attack of breathlessness. Use in Asthma Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs characterized by episodes of difficulty in breathing. People with asthma have extra sensitive or “twitchy” airways. During an asthma attack, the airways react by narrowing making it more difficult for the air to flow in and out of the lungs. If you get a sudden attack of wheezing and breathlessness between your doses of SEREVENT®, you should take one or two puffs from a fast-acting relief medication (e.g. VENTOLIN®) which your doctor has given you. After you have started taking SEREVENT® it is likely that you will not need to use the fast-acting relief medication as often. If you have more than one medicine be careful not to confuse them. Control of asthma requires avoiding irritants that cause asthma attacks and taking the appropriate medications. For example, patients should avoid exposure to house dust mites, mold, pets, tobacco smoke and pollens. The following warning signs indicate that your asthma is getting worse and that your treatment needs to be reassessed by your physician. tightness, or an unusual increase in • A change in your symptoms such as more coughing, attacks of wheezing, chest the breathlessness. You wake up at night with chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath. You use increasing amounts of your fast-acting relief medication. • • • Measurement from your peak flow meter indicates a value between 60 and the severity of 80 percent of predicted or personal best.

In many patients, this narrowing of the airways is a result of many years of cigarette smoking. If you suffer from COPD, you must stop smoking to prevent further lung damage. Please contact your physician or other health care provider for help in smoking cessation. If you are troubled with mucus, try to clear your chest as completely as possible DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 30 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. by coughing before you use SEREVENT®. This will allow SEREVENT® to pass more deeply into your lungs. The following warning signs indicate that your chest condition is worsening. You should contact your physician as soon as possible if you notice: •An unusual increase or decrease in the amount of phlegm. •An unusual increase in the consistency and stickiness of the phlegm. •The presence of blood in phlegm. •A change in the colour of the phlegm to either brown, yellow or green. •An unusual increase in the severity of the breathlessness. •The necessity to increase the number of pillows in order to sleep in comfort. If you have COPD, it is very important that even mild chest infections be treated right away. If you think you have an infection, see your doctor immediately.

For further information or advice, ask your doctor or pharmacist. How Your Medicine Works SEREVENT® DISKHALER® Should Be Used ONLY Twice a Day SEREVENT® DISKHALER® Should NOT Be Used as Relief Medication SEREVENT® (salmeterol xinafoate) is one of a group of medicines called bronchodilators. It works by relieving spasm or narrowing in the small air passages in the lungs causing chest tightness and wheezing. This helps to open up the airways and makes it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. The effects of salmeterol xinafoate last for at least 12 hours. When it is taken regularly, it helps the small air passages to stay open. SEREVENT® is used to help breathing problems in asthma and other chest illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is very important that you use SEREVENT® twice a day, in the morning and again in the evening. This will help protect you against breakthrough symptoms throughout the day and during the night. YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT MORE THAN TWICE A DAY. SEREVENT® does not replace your fast-acting asthma relief medication (e.g. VENTOLIN®, salbutamol) or inhaled anti-inflammatory therapy (e.g. beclomethasone dipropionate or FLOVENT®, fluticasone propionate). Its overuse can be serious. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 37 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. SEREVENT® does NOT act quickly enough to be used as a relief medication. SEREVENT® should NOT be used to provide relief for a sudden attack of breathlessness. Use in Asthma Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs characterized by episodes of difficulty in breathing. People with asthma have extra sensitive or “twitchy” airways. During an asthma attack, the airways react by narrowing making it more difficult for the air to flow in and out of the lungs. If you get a sudden attack of wheezing and breathlessness between your doses of SEREVENT®, you should take one or two puffs from a fast-acting relief medication (e.g. VENTOLIN®) which your doctor has given you. After you have started taking SEREVENT® it is likely that you will not need to use the fast-acting relief medication as often. If you have more than one medicine be careful not to confuse them. Control of asthma requires avoiding irritants that cause asthma attacks and taking the appropriate medications. For example, patients should avoid exposure to house dust mites, mold, pets, tobacco smoke and pollens. The following warning signs indicate that your asthma is getting worse and that your treatment needs to be reassessed by your physician. • • • • A change in your symptoms such as more coughing, attacks of wheezing, chest tightness, or an unusual increase in the severity of the breathlessness. You wake up at night with chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath. You use increasing amounts of your fast-acting relief medication.

The blisters protect the powder for inhalation from effects of atmosphere. The device has a dose counter which tells you the number of doses remaining. It counts down from 60 to 1. To show when the last five doses have been reached the numbers appear in red. When you take your DISKUS® out of its box, it will be in the closed position. A new DISKUS® contains 60 individually protected doses of your medicine, in powder form. The dose indicator tells you how many doses are left. Each dose is accurately measured and hygienically protected. It requires no DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 51 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. maintenance, and no refilling. Numbers 5 to 0 will appear in RED to warn you when there are only a few doses left. How your DISKUS® works The DISKUS® is easy to use. When you need a dose, just follow the four simple steps illustrated: 1. Open 2. Slide 3. Inhale 4. Close Sliding the lever of your DISKUS® opens a small hole in the mouthpiece and unwraps a dose ready for you to inhale it. When you close the DISKUS® , the lever automatically moves back to its original position ready for your next dose when you need it. The outer case protects your DISKUS® when it is not in use. 1. Open To open your DISKUS® hold the outer case in one hand and put the thumb of your other hand on the thumb grip. Push your thumb away from you as far as it will go. 2. Slide Hold your DISKUS® with the mouthpiece towards you. Slide the lever away from you as far as it will go - until it clicks. Your DISKUS® is now ready to use. Every time the lever is pushed back a dose is made available for inhaling. This is shown by the dose counter. Do not play with the lever as this releases doses which will be wasted. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 52 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. 3. Inhale Before you start to inhale the dose read through this section carefully. Hold the DISKUS® away from your mouth. Breathe out as far Put the mouthpiece to your lips. Breathe in steadily and deeply * as is comfortable. Remember - never breathe into your DISKUS® . * - through the DISKUS® , not through your nose. Remove the DISKUS® from your mouth. * * Hold your breath for about 10 seconds or for as long as is comfortable. Breathe out slowly. * 4. Close To close your DISKUS® , put your thumb in the thumb grip, and slide the thumb grip back towards you, as far as it will go. When you close the DISKUS® , it clicks shut. The lever automatically returns to its original position and is reset. Your DISKUS® is now ready for you to use again. After taking your SEREVENT® DISKUS® If you notice a sudden worsening of your shortness of breath and wheeze shortly after using your device, tell your doctor as soon as possible. Even if you feel much better after starting to use SEREVENT®, you must continue to use your other asthma or COPD medication(s) according to your doctor's instructions. Very occasionally some people feel a little shaky or have a headache or notice that their heart is beating faster than usual. These effects usually wear off with continued treatment. Tell your doctor but do not stop using the medicine unless told to do so. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 53 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Medicines affect different people in different ways.

Animals Pharmacology Salmeterol is a potent, selective $2-agonist in respiratory smooth muscle and on lung mast cells. Salmeterol is virtually devoid of $1-adrenoceptor activity with only weak agonist activity at $3-adrenoceptors. In vitro Studies In the isolated, electrically-stimulated guinea pig trachea, salmeterol was 7-fold more potent than isoprenaline and 20-fold more potent than salbutamol. In the PGF2 \"-contracted guinea pig tracheal strip, salmeterol was equipotent with isoprenaline and twice as potent as salbutamol (EC50 3.5nM salmeterol, and 6.4nM salbutamol). Salmeterol xinafoate was an extremely weak partial agonist the electrically-driven left atrium of the rat, a $1-adrenoceptor containing preparation. in In the isolated guinea-pig fundus preparation, salmeterol xinafoate produced smooth muscle relaxation. The concentration required to cause relaxation of guinea-pig fundus, containing $3-adrenoceptors, was at least 1000-times higher than that required to activate $2-adrenoceptors in airways smooth muscle. Salmeterol has a significantly longer duration of action than salbutamol (12 minutes and 2-4 minutes, respectively). This was confirmed in the electrically-stimulated guinea pig trachea where there was less than 50% recovery from the inhibitory responses to even submaximally effective concentrations of salmeterol xinafoate for periods in excess of 8 hours, despite continuous superfusion of the tissue without drug. The persistent action of the drug could be fully reversed by the $1 and $2-adrenoceptor blocker, sotalol, but when the antagonist was washed out, the activity of salmeterol was reasserted. In contrast, salbutamol and isoprenaline exhibited shorter durations of action (2-3 minutes and 11.4 minutes respectively). DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 56 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Despite the sustained agonist action, no tolerance or tachyphylaxis has been observed with salmeterol in respiratory smooth muscle. Binding studies in rats have shown evidence of slow dissociation of the drug from its receptor site. The long duration of effect of salmeterol is due to a unique method of action whereby a portion of the molecule binds with high affinity to non-polar domains or exosites from where the rest of the molecule can interact freely with the active site of the $2-adrenoceptor. in conscious guinea-pigs Nebulised aerosols of In vivo Studies The potency and duration of action of the bronchodilator activity of salmeterol inhaled and oral was determined administration. to 5-5000mcg/mL) caused dose-related inhibition of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, with bronchodilator activity being similar to salbutamol. There were no clear differences between the durations of action of salmeterol and salbutamol by the oral route. following (0.012-12:M, equivalent However, following inhaled administration, the duration of action of salmeterol was substantially longer, exceeding 6 hours, at concentrations of 50mcg/mL and above, compared with 1.5-3 hours for salbutamol (478mcg/mL). Nebulised aerosols of salmeterol (0.001-1mg/mL) caused a dose-related inhibition of plasma protein extravasation (PPE) induced by histamine. Both salmeterol and salbutamol had an ED50 of approximately 0.01mg/mL, but the duration of action of salmeterol was substantially longer, being 6-8 hours compared with less than 2 hours for salbutamol. Orally administered salmeterol (0.01-1mg/kg) also reduced histamine-induced PPE in a dose-related manner with an ED50 of 0.02mg/kg. Prior treatment of animals with propranolol abolished the inhibition of PPE, indicating that these effects were mediated by $-adrenoceptors, probably at the level of the vascular endothelium. The effects of salmeterol (as either the base or the xinafoate salt) on behaviour, DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 57 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. muscle tone, reflexes and autonomic function were investigated following intravenous dosing in the dog and acute oral administration in conscious rat and dog. These effects were consistent with the known pharmacology of $2-adrenoceptor agonists. Salmeterol base (0.1-1.0mg/kg i.v.) in the dog caused marked tachycardia. At 0.3mg/kg, there was slight vasodilation and vomiting. Animals receiving 1mg/kg showed signs of subdued behaviour. Salmeterol (25-100mg/kg p.o.) reduced general activity in the rat. In the dog, oral salmeterol (1, 3 and 10mg/kg) induced persistent tachycardia and cutaneous vasodilation, with some lacrimation occurring at 3 and 10mg/kg. Salmeterol caused no overt effects on gastrointestinal function following oral administration, producing no emetic or defaecatory effects in dogs over the dose range 1-10mg/kg and no effects on defaecatory activity in rats at doses of 25-100mg/kg. However, emesis was observed in the dog following intravenous doses of 0.3 and 1mg/kg. In conscious cynomolgus monkey, oral salmeterol (1 & 10mg/kg) had only minor cardiovascular effects, causing small increases in heart rate which were not clearly dose-related. There was no evidence of dysrhythmia or of significant changes in the electrocardiogram at either dose level. Salmeterol did not affect pentobarbitone-induced sleeping time in mice suggesting it is unlikely to interfere with hepatic drug metabolism. Pharmacokinetics Salmeterol is extensively absorbed across the GI tract in both rat and dog following oral administration. However, the clearance of salmeterol is about three times higher in rat than in dog indicating that hepatic extraction is also higher in the rat. In radiolabelled studies in rat, dog, mouse and pregnant rabbit, peak plasma levels were attained within 1 hour of dosing and were much lower than the mean peak concentrations of indicating extensive metabolism. However, salmeterol represented a much higher proportion of the circulating radioactivity in the dog than in the rat. This is consistent with the oral bioavailability of salmeterol being lower in rat (<15%) than in dog (approx. 60%). total drug-related material DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 58 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. The maximum concentrations of salmeterol detected in plasma from animals in repeat dose, combined oral/inhalation toxicity studies exceeds by several hundred-fold the maximum concentrations (200pg/mL) determined after the standard therapeutic dose in humans. The species used in toxicological studies were subjected to a systemic exposure of salmeterol of up to 1800-fold greater than that resulting from the therapeutic dosage in humans. The distribution of salmeterol xinafoate in body tissues is consistent with that expected of a highly lipophilic base. At least 93% of the salmeterol distributed between erythrocytes and plasma is reversibly bound to the plasma proteins, $1-acid glycoprotein and albumin, in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and in man. The high plasma clearance of salmeterol indicates that changes in the degree of protein binding are unlikely to influence the rate of elimination. In all species, salmeterol and its metabolites are excreted predominantly in the bile. Enterohepatic circulation of salmeterol has been demonstrated in the rat; however, no enterohepatic circulation of drug-related material occurs in the dog. Glucuronidation of salmeterol is the major metabolic pathway in the rat, rabbit and mouse, but not in the dog. The major metabolite of salmeterol in humans, hydroxylated on the butyl chain, is only a minor metabolite in the rat. However, exposure to this metabolite during rat toxicology studies was 100-fold greater than in humans. The pharmacokinetics of hydroxynaphthoic acid (HNA), a xenobiotic, has been extensively investigated in both animal and human studies. Tissue distribution studies in rat have shown that HNA is rapidly absorbed in the blood and widely distributed following administration. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 59 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. With the exception of the rabbit, HNA accumulates on repeat dosing in animals. Accumulation was also observed in humans, but the steady-state concentrations (100NG/mL) in humans were 1000-fold lower than those seen in species used in toxicology testing. It is likely that the major metabolite of HNA in humans is the same as that in rats. HNA and its metabolites are excreted predominantly via urine. Human Human Pharmacology Salmeterol caused a concentration-related inhibition of mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes C4/D4 and PGD2 in sensitised human lung tissue and was significantly more potent than salbutamol. Inhibition of mediator release induced by salbutamol was of short duration of action (<2 hours) whereas significant activity was observed with salmeterol after 20 hours. The pharmacodynamics of salmeterol has been investigated in healthy subjects and in patients with reversible airways obstruction. In healthy subjects, there were pharmacologically predictable extra-pulmonary effects on pulse rate, tremor and metabolic parameters. These effects, however, became clinically significant only at doses of 200mcg and greater. In patients, salmeterol by both pressurised and powder inhalers in single doses of 25mcg or greater has been shown to produce bronchodilation lasting for approximately 12 hours. This long duration of action has been confirmed by challenge studies using exercise, histamine and methacholine as bronchoconstrictor agents. Salmeterol has also been shown to abolish both the early and late phase bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled allergen, the clinical significance of which has not been established. The onset of bronchodilator action of salmeterol (10-20 minutes) is slower than that seen with salbutamol (5-15 minutes). There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis in the bronchodilator effects of salmeterol. Human Pharmacokinetics Following inhalation of a single dose of 50mcg salmeterol, plasma concentrations of approximately 200pg/mL were detected. Since salmeterol acts locally in the DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 60 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. lung, plasma levels are not predictive of therapeutic effect. Asthma - Clinical Experience Use in adolescents and adults The efficacy of salmeterol was evaluated in controlled clinical studies using both the aerosol and dry powder formulations. The doses used in these studies were 50mcg bid and 100mcg bid for moderate to severe patients. These studies involved over 1500 patients with mild, moderate and severe airways obstruction. In these trials, salmeterol demonstrated superior efficacy as compared with salbutamol 200mcg (aerosol) and 400mcg (powder) four times daily, and dose-titrated theophylline, twice daily. In these trials, salmeterol treatment significantly improved lung function and reduced nocturnal and daytime symptoms and the requirement for additional short-acting inhaled bronchodilators (e.g. salbutamol). There were no significant differences between the aerosol and dry powder formulations with respect to any of the efficacy parameters. SEREVENT® Nationwide Post Marketing Surveillance Study Subsequent to the completion of the clinical trial program, a large scale post marketing surveillance study, involving 25,180 patients was carried out in the UK, to compare safety of salmeterol and salbutamol in treating asthma. This was a randomised, double blind, double-dummy, parallel group, 16 week study. Randomisation was 2 salmeterol patients: 1 salbutamol patient. Medical withdrawals due to asthma were statistically significant, fewer with salmeterol than with salbutamol (2.91% vs. 3.79%, p=0.0002). However there was a small increase in mortality in the group taking salmeterol for obstructive airways disease deaths [16 (0.10%) in salmeterol and 3 (0.04%) in salbutamol groups (p=0.105)] and cardiovascular deaths [29 (0.17%) in salmeterol and 10 (0.12%) in salbutamol (p=0.308)]. For both treatment groups the number of non fatal adverse events was related DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 61 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. to severity of asthma on entry. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - Clinical Experience In two large randomized, double-blind studies, SEREVENT® inhalation aerosol was compared with placebo and ipratropium bromide in patients with COPD (emphysema and chronic bronchitis), including patients who were reversible ($12% and $200mL increase in baseline FEV1 after salbutamol treatment) and non-reversible to salbutamol. After a single 50mcg dose of SEREVENT®, significant improvement in pulmonary function (mean FEV1 increase of 12% or more) occurred within 30 minutes, reached a peak within 4 hours on average and persisted for 12 hours with no loss in effectiveness observed over a 12-week treatment period. Serial 12 hour measurements of FEV1 from these two 12 week trials are shown below for both the first and last treatment days.

F E V 1 area under the curve (FEV1 over time) was consistently greater with SEREVENT® as compared to ipratropium in the total population and in patients reversible to salbutamol. SEREVENT® and ipratropium had a similar treatment response in patients that were non-reversible to salbutamol. Results similar to those shown above were seen in the groups reversible and non-reversible to salbutamol. However, the magnitude of response was greater in the group of patients reversible to salbutamol. In addition, improvement in dyspnea as measured using the Baseline Dyspnea Index and Transitional Dyspnea Index occurred within 2 weeks of treatment. Improvement in dyspnea was sustained over 12 weeks of treatment. No clinically significant age or gender related differences in efficacy were observed. Improvement in disease specific quality of life was assessed using the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. In patients using SEREVENT® a significantly greater percentage of patients showed improvement in global quality of life scores (46%) as compared to patients receiving placebo (32%). DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 63 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Toxicology Animals Acute Toxicity Extremely high levels of salmeterol xinafoate, relative to the therapeutic dose, were tolerated irrespective of the route of administration or species employed. At the maximum achievable or maximum non-lethal dosages, clinical signs were generally non-specific or were expected consequences of the pharmacological activity of salmeterol (e.g. vasodilation and tachycardia in dogs). There were no findings indicative of specific target organ toxicity and salmeterol was well tolerated in the respiratory tract. Species Mouse Rat Rat (juv.) Rat Dog Approx. LD50 (mg/kg) Maximum Non-Lethal Dose [MNLD] (mg/kg) MNLD as a Multiple of Therapeutic Dose > 150 ; $ 500 > 600 > 300 > 2.9 > 0.7 $ 150 $ 1000 $ 300 $ 2.9 $ 0.7 > 75,000 > 500,000 > 150,000 > 1400 > 350 Longterm Toxicity Subacute toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks in rats, at doses up to 0.7mg/kg/day by inhalation and/or 2.0mg/kg/day orally were conducted. No significant treatment-induced changes were seen. Findings included reductions in the number of platelets, decreased plasma glucose, increased urea and creatinine, increased urine volume associated with decreased specific gravity, increased heart and lung weights, and decreased liver and kidney weights. These regressed following a 4-week recovery period and were considered to be a consequence of the pharmacological activity of salmeterol. Slight increases in serum transaminases and bilirubin concentration were considered to reflect metabolic adaptation by the liver to high circulating concentrations of salmeterol and regressed fully during the recovery period. In dog studies up to 13 weeks, reductions in mean cell volume and mean cell DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 64 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. haemoglobin, and increases in anisocytosis and hypochromia were found to occur at doses greater than 0.05mg/kg/day orally and 0.07mg/kg/day by inhalation. In two female dogs treated at these dosages, histological changes were observed in the papillary muscle of the heart in common with known effects of other adrenoceptor agonists. Chronic toxicity studies were carried out for up to 18 months in rats and up to 12 months in dogs. Repeated high exposures to salmeterol xinafoate were tolerated well by rats and dogs, both locally within the respiratory tract, and systemically. Minor laryngeal changes occurred only after prolonged exposure to high inhaled doses ($0.18mg/kg/day) and were confined to the rat, a species known to be especially sensitive. Other findings were a consequence of excessive pharmacological activity or expected metabolic adjustments in response to high circulating plasma to hydroxynaphthoic acid were observed in any study. No effects attributable levels of salmeterol. A slight, work-induced increase in heart weight was found to occur in rats treated with inhaled salmeterol xinafoate. Cardiovascular effects in dogs dosed orally at 0.1-10.0mg/kg/day included slight to marked transient reflex tachycardia as a consequence of peripheral vasodilation and occasional areas of focal papillary muscle necrosis as a consequence of tachycardia. Skeletal muscle hypertrophy was evident in rats and dogs treated orally or by inhalation. In rats, the effect diminished with extended treatment and reversed over 18 months. Small increases in plasma urea and creatinine in some rat and dog studies were concluded to be associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy; no renal pathology was detected. Minor fluctuations in serum enzyme activity levels occurred in some rat studies without significant histopathological changes and were attributed to slight metabolic adjustments by the liver to high circulating salmeterol levels. Mild, transient reductions in some erythrocyte measurements occurred in some dogs treated orally at doses of 1mg/kg/day or more of salmeterol. The effects regressed despite continued treatment. DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 65 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Carcinogenicity In an 18-month oral carcinogenicity study in CD-mice, salmeterol xinafoate caused a dose-related increase in the incidence of smooth muscle hyperplasia, cystic glandular hyperplasia, and leiomyomas of the uterus and a dose-related increase in the incidence of cysts in the ovaries. A higher incidence of leiomyosarcomas was not statistically significant; tumor findings were observed at oral doses of 1.4 and 10mg/kg, which gave 9 and 63 times, respectively, the human exposure based on rodent:human AUC comparisons. Salmeterol caused a dose-related increase in the incidence of mesovarian leiomyomas and ovarian cysts in Sprague Dawley rats in a 24-month inhalation/oral carcinogenicity study. Tumors were observed in rats receiving doses of 0.68 and 2.58mg/kg per day (about 55 and 215 times the recommended clinical dose [mg/m2]). These findings in rodents are similar to those reported previously for other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs. The relevance of these findings to human use is unknown. No significant effects occurred in mice at 0.2mg/kg (1.3 times the recommended clinical dose based on comparisons of the AUCs) and in rats at 0.21mg/kg (15 times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis). Mutagenicity Salmeterol xinafoate produced no detectable or reproducible increases in microbial and mammalian gene mutation in vitro. No blastogenic activity occurred in vitro in human lymphocytes or in vivo in a rat micronucleus test. No effects on fertility were identified in male and female rats treated orally with salmeterol xinafoate at doses up to 2mg/kg orally (about 160 times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis). Reproduction and Teratology No significant effects of maternal exposure to oral salmeterol xinafoate occurred in the rat at doses up to the equivalent of about 160 times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis. Dutch rabbit fetuses exposed to salmeterol xinafoate from beta-adrenoceptor stimulation; these included precocious eyelid openings, cleft palate, sternebral fusion, limb and paw flexures, and delayed ossification of the in utero exhibited effects characteristically resulting DCTM\\201\\529\\15a_Serevent_PM_pristine.wpd 66 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. frontal cranial bones. No significant effects occurred at 0.6mg/kg given orally (12 times the recommended clinical dose based on comparison of the AUCs). New Zealand White rabbits were less sensitive since only delayed ossification of the frontal bones was seen at 10mg/kg given orally (approximately 1,600 times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m2 basis). Extensive use of other beta-agonists has provided no evidence that these class effects in animals are relevant to use in humans. Irritancy & Local Tolerance In an eye irritation study, 4 puffs (100mg/puff) of salmeterol aerosol suspension were administered to the right eyes of female New Zealand white rabbits. The left eyes served as controls. No signs of iritis or irritant reaction of the cornea were seen over the 24-hour period following the administration of salmeterol xinafoate aerosol.

MONOGRAPH PrDom-FLUOXETINE (Fluoxetine hydrochloride USP) Capsules and Oral Solution Antidepressant/Antiobsessional/Antibulimic DOMINION PHARMACAL 6111 Royalmount, Suite 100 Montréal, Québec H4P 2T4 Control:082447 DATE OF PREPARATION: February 5, 2002 DATE OF REVISION: PRODUCT MONOGRAPH PrDom-FLUOXETINE (Fluoxetine hydrochloride USP) CAPSULES AND ORAL SOLUTION THERAPEUTIC CLASSIFICATION Antidepressant/Antiobsessional/Antibulimic Agent ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The antidepressant, antiobsessional, and antibulimic actions of fluoxetine are presumed to be linked to its ability to selectively inhibit the neuronal reuptake of serotonin. At clinically relevant doses fluoxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic and \"1- adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative and cardiovascular effects of classical tricyclic antidepressant drugs. In vitro receptor binding studies have demonstrated that fluoxetine binds to these and other membrane receptors [opiate, serotonergic (5-HT1, 5-HT2), adrenergic (\"1, \"2,$) and dopaminergic] much less potently than do the tricyclic drugs. Pharmacokinetics Fluoxetine is well absorbed after oral administration. In man, following a single oral 40 mg dose, peak plasma concentrations of fluoxetine from 15 to 55 ng/mL are observed after 6 to 8 hours. The capsule and oral solution dosage forms of fluoxetine are bioequivalent. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of fluoxetine, although it may delay its absorption inconsequentially. Thus fluoxetine may be administered with or without food. 2 Fluoxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver to norfluoxetine, and other unidentified metabolites. The pharmacological activity of norfluoxetine, which is formed by demethylation of fluoxetine appears to be similar to that of the parent drug. Norfluoxetine contributes to the long duration of action of fluoxetine. The primary route of elimination appears to be hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites excreted by the kidney. Clinical Issues Related to Metabolism/Elimination Variability in Metabolism: The metabolism of fluoxetine, like that of a number of other compounds, including tricyclic antidepressants and some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs), involves the P450IID6 system. Concomitant therapy with fluoxetine and the aforementioned drugs may lead to clinically significant drug interactions (see Drug Interactions under PRECAUTIONS). Accumulation and Slow Elimination The relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, results in significant accumulation of these active moieties in chronic use. Therefore, it may take up to 1 to 2 months for the active drug substance(s) to disappear from the body. This persistence of active moieties is important to keep in mind when fluoxetine is discontinued, or when drugs that are predicted to interact with fluoxetine are to be administered soon after its discontinuation (see Implications of the Long Elimination Half-Life of Fluoxetine under WARNINGS and Drug Interactions under PRECAUTIONS. Kinetic Data After 30 days of dosing at 20 mg/day, mean plasma concentrations of fluoxetine 79.1 ± 33.4 ng/mL and of norfluoxetine 129 ± 42.0 ng/mL have been observed. Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine (elimination half-life of 1 to 3 days after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after chronic administration) were higher than those predicted by single-dose studies. Norfluoxetine appears to have linear pharmacokinetics. Its mean terminal half-lifes after a single dose and multiple doses were 8.6 days and 9.3 days, respectively. 3 Steady state plasma levels are attained after 4 to 5 weeks of continuous drug administration. Patients receiving fluoxetine at doses of 40 to 80 mg/day over periods as long as 3 years exhibited, on average, plasma concentrations similar to those seen among patients treated for 4 to 5 weeks at the same dose. Age The effects of age upon the metabolism of fluoxetine have been investigated in a subset of 260 elderly, but otherwise healthy, depressed patients (mean age: 67.4 yr, range 60 to 85 yr) who received 20 mg fluoxetine for 6 weeks. Mean plasma concentrations were found to be 89.5 ± 53.6 ng/mL for fluoxetine and 119 ± 51.3 ng/mL for norfluoxetine. However, the effects of concomitant illness and/or concomitant drugs have not been evaluated. Protein Binding Approximately 94% of fluoxetine is protein bound. The interaction between fluoxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated, but may be important (see PRECAUTIONS). Liver Disease In patients with cirrhosis, the elimination half-life of fluoxetine was prolonged, with a mean of 7.6 days compared to a range of 2 to 3 days seen in healthy subjects; norfluoxetine half-life was also prolonged, with a mean of 12 days compared to a range of 7 to 9 days in healthy subjects. Fluoxetine should therefore be used with caution in patients with liver disease (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 4 Renal Disease In single dose studies, the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were similar among subjects with all levels of impaired renal function including anephric patients on chronic hemodialysis. However, with chronic administration, additional accumulation of fluoxetine or its metabolites (possibly including some not yet identified) may occur in patients with severely impaired renal function, and the use of a lower or less frequent dose is advised (see PRECAUTIONS). Clinical trials The efficacy of fluoxetine was established in 5- and 6- week placebo-controlled clinical trials in depressed outpatients (> 18 yr of age), who meet the DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder. Two, 6-week placebo-controlled clinical trials in depressed elderly patients, who met the DSM-III- R criteria for major depressive disorder (mean age 67.4 yr, range 60 to 85 yr) have shown fluoxetine, 20 mg/day, to be effective. A study was conducted involving depressed outpatients who had responded (modified HAMD-17 score of #7 during each of the last 3 weeks of open-label treatment and absence of major depression by DSM-III-R criteria) by the end of an initial 12-week open treatment phase on fluoxetine 20 mg/day. These patients (N=298) were randomized to continuation on double-blind fluoxetine 20 mg/day or placebo. At 38 weeks (50 weeks total), a statistically significantly lower relapse rate (defined as symptoms sufficient to meet a diagnosis of major depression for 2 weeks or a modified HAMD-17 score of $ 14 for 3 weeks) was observed for patients taking fluoxetine compared to those on placebo. A comparative bioavailability study of fluoxetine capsules 20 mg was performed. Pharmacokinetic and bioavailabilty data were measured in 90 volunteers in the fasting state. The results can be summarized as follows: 5 SUMMARY OF COMPARATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY DATA [single 40 mg (2 × 20 mg capsule) oral administration in the fasting state] Fluoxetine Capsules 20 mg (Dominion Pharmacal, Canada, Lot# 670145) PROZAC 20 mg Capsules (Eli Lilly Canada Inc., Canada, Lot# 40099) versus Measured Data Geometric Mean Arithmetic Mean (CV%) Ratio of Geometric Means (%) Parameter AUC0-72h (ng•h/mL) Cmax (ng/mL) Tmax (h) T½el (h) Test 803.85 Reference 846.88 839.80 (31.2) 890.37 (33.8) 23.43 23.96 (21.6) 24.96 25.61 (23.0) 8.00 (18.3) 8.23 (24.6) 33.59 (40.5) 31.39 (36.3) Tmax and T½el -- presented as the arithmetic means with CV in parenthesis. 95 94 ---- ---- INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE 6 Depression Dom-FLUOXETINE (fluoxetine) is indicated for the symptomatic relief of depressive illness. Bulimia Nervosa Dom-FLUOXETINE has been shown to significantly decrease binge-eating and purging activity when compared with placebo treatment. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Dom-FLUOXETINE has been shown to significantly reduce the symptoms of obsessive- compulsive disorder in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The obsessions or compulsions must be experienced as intrusive, markedly distressing, time consuming, or interfering significantly with the person’s social or occupational functioning. The efficacy of Dom-FLUOXETINE in hospitalized patients has not been adequately studied. The long-term effectiveness of Dom-FLUOXETINE in bulimia nervosa (i.e., for more than 16 weeks) and in obsessive compulsive disorder (i.e., for more than 13 weeks), has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Dom- FLUOXETINE in these indications for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long- term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. 7 CONTRAINDICATIONS Fluoxetine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors--There have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions (including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) in patients receiving fluoxetine in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and in patients who have recently discontinued fluoxetine and then started on an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (e.g., serotonin syndrome). Therefore, fluoxetine should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within a minimum of 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI. Since fluoxetine and its major metabolite have very long elimination half-lives, at least 5 weeks should be allowed after stopping fluoxetine before starting an MAOI. Limited reports suggest that intravenously administered dantrolene (Dantrium®) or orally administered cyproheptadine (Periactin®) may benefit patients experiencing such reactions. Thioridazine - Thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued (see WARNINGS). 8 WARNINGS Allergic Reactions (Rash and Accompanying Events) During premarketing testing, 7% of 10,782 patients developed various types rashes and/or urticaria. Among these cases, almost a third were withdrawn from treatment because of the rash and/or systemic signs or symptoms associated with the rash. Clinical findings reported in association with these allergic reactions include rash, fever, leukocytosis, arthralgias, edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, respiratory distress, lymphadenopathy, proteinuria, and mild transaminase elevation. Most patients improved promptly with discontinuation of fluoxetine and/or adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids, and all patients experiencing these events were reported to recover completely. In premarketing clinical trials two patients are known to have developed a serious cutaneous systemic illness. In neither patient was there an unequivocal diagnosis, but one was considered to have a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and the other severe desquamation that was considered variously to be a vasculitis or erythema multiforme. Other patients have had systemic manifestations suggestive of serum sickness. Since the introduction of fluoxetine, systemic events, possibly related to vasculitis, and including lupus-like syndrome, have developed in patients with rash. Although these events are rare, they may be serious, involving the lung, kidney, or liver. Death has been reported to occur in association with these systemic events. Anaphylactoid events, including bronchospasm, angioedema, laryngospasm and urticaria alone and in combination, have been reported. Pulmonary events, including inflammatory processes of varying histopathology and/or fibrosis, have been reported rarely. These events have occurred with dyspnea as the only preceding symptom. 9 Whether these systemic events and rash have a common underlying cause or are due to different etiologies or pathogenic processes is not known. Furthermore, a specific underlying immunologic basis for these events has not been identified. Upon the appearance of rash or of other possibly allergic phenomena for which an alternative etiology cannot be identified, fluoxetine should be discontinued. Particular caution should be exercised in patients with a history of allergic reactions. Potential Interaction With Thioridazine In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher Cmax and a 4.5 - fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared to the rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of cytochrome P4502D6 isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs which inhibit P4502D6, such as certain SSRIs, including fluoxetine, will produce elevated plasma levels of thioridazine (see PRECAUTIONS) Thioridizine administration produces a dose-related prolongation of the QTc interval which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes-type arrhythmias, and sudden death. The risk is expected to increase with fluoxetine-induced inhibition of thioridazone metabolism (see CONTRAINDICATION) Implications of the Long Elimination Half-Life of Fluoxetine Because of the long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and its major active metabolite norfluoxetine, changes in dose will not be fully reflected in plasma for several weeks, affecting both strategies for titration to final dose and withdrawal from treatment (see ACTION and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Even when dosing is stopped, active drug substance will persist in the body for weeks due to the long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following 10 discontinuation of fluoxetine. PRECAUTIONS Anxiety and Insomnia During premarketing clinical trials anxiety, nervousness and insomnia were reported by 10 to 15% of patients treated with fluoxetine. These symptoms led to discontinuation of the drug in 5% of the patients. Weight Change Significant weight loss, especially in underweight depressed patients and the elderly, may be an undesirable result of treatment with fluoxetine. Mania/Hypomania During premarketing clinical trials in a patient population comprised primarily of unipolar depressives, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of fluoxetine treated patients. The incidence in a general patient population which might also include bipolar depressives is unknown. The likelihood of hypomanic or manic episodes may be increased at the higher dosage levels. Such reactions require a reduction in dosage or discontinuation of the drug. Seizures Fluoxetine should be used with caution in patients with a history of convulsive disorders. The incidence of seizures associated with fluoxetine during clinical trials did not appear to differ from that reported with other marketed antidepressants; however, patients with a history of convulsive disorders were excluded from these trials. Concurrent administration with electroshock therapy should be avoided because of the absence of experience in this area. There have been rare reports of prolonged seizures in patients on fluoxetine receiving ECT treatment. 11 Hypokalemia Self-induced vomiting often leads to hypokalemia which may lower seizure threshold and/or may lead to cardiac conduction abnormalities. Electrolyte levels of bulimic patients should be assessed prior to initiation of treatment. Suicide The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in depression and may persist until significant remission occurs. Therefore, high risk patients should be closely supervised throughout therapy and consideration should be given to the possible need for hospitalization. In order to minimize the opportunity for overdosage, prescriptions for fluoxetine should be written for the smallest quantity of drug consistent with good patient management. Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with fluoxetine in patients with concomitant systemic illness is limited and it should be used cautiously in such patients, especially those with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Fluoxetine has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were systematically excluded from premarketing clinical studies. Retrospective evaluation of EKGs in some of these studies showed no conduction abnormalities that resulted in heart block. The mean heart rate was reduced by approximately 3 beats/minute. Fluoxetine should be given with caution to patients suffering from anorexia nervosa and only if the expected benefits (e.g. co-morbid depression) markedly outweigh the potential weight reducing effect of the drug. In patients with diabetes, fluoxetine may alter glycemic control. Hypoglycemia has occurred 12 during therapy with fluoxetine, and hyperglycemia has developed following discontinuation of the drug. As is true with many other types of medication when taken concurrently by patients with diabetes, insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic dosage may need to be adjusted when therapy with fluoxetine is instituted or discontinued. Since fluoxetine is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. However, until an adequate number of patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated in the course of chronic treatment, fluoxetine should be used with caution in such patients. Since clearances of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may be decreased in patients with impaired liver function including cirrhosis, a lower or less frequent dose should be used in such patients. Hyponatremia Several cases of hyponatremia (some with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L) have been reported. The hyponatremia appeared to be reversible when fluoxetine was discontinued. Although these cases were complex with varying possible etiologies, some were possibly due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The majority of these occurrences have been in older patients and in patients taking diuretics or who were otherwise volume depleted. In two 6-week controlled studies in patients $60 years of age, 10 of 323 fluoxetine patients and 6 of 320 placebo-treated recipients had a lowering of serum sodium below the reference range; this difference was not statistically significant. The lowest observed concentration of sodium in a fluoxetine treated patient was 129 mmol/L. The observed decreases were not clinically significant. 13 Platelet Function There have been rare reports of altered platelet function and/or abnormal results from laboratory studies in patients taking fluoxetine. While there have been reports of abnormal bleeding in several patients taking fluoxetine, it is unclear whether fluoxetine had a causative role. Cognitive and Motor Performance Patients should be cautioned against driving an automobile or performing hazardous tasks until they are reasonably certain that treatment with fluoxetine does not affect them adversely. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) There are no clinical studies to support the safety and efficacy of combined use of ECT and fluoxetine. There have been rare reports of prolonged seizures in patients on fluoxetine receiving ECT treatment. Use in Pregnancy Safe use of fluoxetine during pregnancy has not been established. Therefore fluoxetine should not be administered to women of childbearing potential unless, in the opinion of the treating physician, the expected benefits to the patient markedly outweigh the possible hazards to the fetus or the child. Use in Lactation Fluoxetine and its metabolites are excreted in breast milk, and have been observed to reach high plasma levels in nursing infants. Women who are taking fluoxetine should not breast feed unless, in the opinion of the treating physician, breast feeding is necessary, in which case the infant should be closely monitored. In one breast milk sample, the concentration of fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine was 70.4 ng/mL. The concentration in the mother's plasma was 295.0 ng/mL. No adverse effects on the infant were reported. In another case, a 6-week infant, nursed by a mother on fluoxetine, developed crying, decreased sleep, vomiting and watery stools. The breast milk showed concentrations of 69 ng/mL 14 for fluoxetine and 90 ng/mL for norfluoxetine. In the infant’s plasma, the concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine on the second day of feeding were 340 and 208 ng/mL, respectively. Use in Children Safety and effectiveness in patients below the age of 18 have not been established. Use in the Elderly Evaluation of patients over the age of 60 who received fluoxetine 20 mg daily revealed no unusual pattern of adverse events relative to the clinical experience in younger patients. These data are however insufficient to rule out possible age-related differences during chronic use, particularly in elderly patients who have concomitant systemic illnesses or who are receiving concomitant drugs. Drug Interactions: Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Combined use of CONTRAINDICATIONS). fluoxetine and MAO inhibitors is contraindicated (see Tricyclic Antidepressants In two studies, previously stable plasma levels of imipramine and desipramine have increased greater than 2 to 10-fold when fluoxetine has been administered in combination. This influence may persist for three weeks or longer after fluoxetine is discontinued. Thus, the dose of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) may need to be reduced and plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored temporarily when fluoxetine is coadministered or has been recently discontinued. (See Acculmulation and Slow Elimination under ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and P450 ISOENZYME (IID6) under PRECAUTIONS). 15 Lithium There have been reports of both increased and decreased lithium levels when lithium was used concomitantly with fluoxetine. Cases of lithium toxicity have been reported. Lithium levels should be monitored when these drugs are administered concomitantly. Tryptophan Five patients receiving fluoxetine in combination with tryptophan experienced adverse reactions, including agitation, restlessness and gastrointestinal distress. Benzodiazepines The half-life of concurrently administered diazepam may be prolonged in some patients. Coadministration of alprazolam and fluoxetine has resulted in increased alprazolam plasma concentrations and in further psychomotor performance decrement due to increased alprazolam levels. Consideration should be given to monitoring of clinical status. Experience with the use of fluoxetine in combination with other CNS-active drugs is limited and caution is advised if such concomitant medication is required (see WARNINGS). Phenytoin In patients on stable, maintenance doses of phenytoin, plasma phenytoin concentrations increased substantially and symptoms of phenytoin toxicity appeared (nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia and CNS depression) following initiation of concomitant treatment. Carbamazepine Patients on stable doses of phenytoin and carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concominant fluoxetine treatment. Consideration should be given to monitoring of clinical status when fluoxetine treatment is initiated in these patients. Antipsychotics 16 Elevation of blood levels of haloperidol and clozpaine and in some cases, clinical manifestations of toxicity have been observed with coadministration of fluoxetine. Consideration should be given to monitoring of clinical status. Sumatriptan There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of an SSRI and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, or citalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Alcohol The concomitant use of fluoxetine and alcohol on cognitive and psychomotor effects in depressed, panic disorder or OCD patients is not known and is not recommended. St. John’s Wort In common with other SSRIs pharmacodynamic interactions between fluoxetine and the herbal remedy St. John’s Wort may occur and may result in an increase in undesirable effects. Drugs Tightly Bound To Plasma Protein Because fluoxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, the adminstration of fluoxetine to a patient taking another drug which is tightly bound to protein (e.g, warfarin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentration potentially resulting in an adverse effect. Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein bound fluoxetine by other tightly bound drugs. Warfarin Altered anti-coagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when fluoxetine is co-administered with warfarin. Serious bleeding events have been reported including five with outcome of death. However, a casual relationship to the bleeding events cannot be established. Therefore, patients receiving warfarin therapy should receive careful coagulation monitering when 17 fluoxetine is initiated or stopped. Drugs Metabolized by P4502D6 Isoenzyme Approximately 3 to 10% of the normal population has a genetic defect that leads to reduced levels of activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme P450IID6. Such individuals have been referred to as “poor metabolizers” of drugs such as debrisoquine, dextrometorphan, sparteine, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. nortryptiline, amitriptyline, imipramine, and desipramine), phenothiazine neuroleptics (e.g. perphenazine and thioridazine) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g. propafenone and flecainide). Conversely, approximately 90 to 97% of the normal population do not have this genetic defect, and are known as “extensive metabolizers”. Fluoxetine, like other agents that are metabolized by the P450IID6 system, inhibits the activity of this isoenzyme, and thus may make normal “extensive” metabolizers resemble “poor metabolizers”. Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the P450IID6 system and that have a relatively narrow therapeutic index (e.g. flecainide, encainida, vinblastine, carbamazepine and tricyclic antidepressants) should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently, or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by P450IID6 the need for decreased dose of the original medication should be considered. The aforementioned drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern. Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). Drugs Metabolized By Cytochrome P4503A4 In an in vivo interaction study involving co-administration of fluoxetine with single doses of 18 terfenadine (a cytochrome P4503A4 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine concentrations occurred with concominant fluoxetine. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of P4503A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than fluoxetine or norfluoxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including astemizole, cisapride, and midazolam. These data indicate the fluoxetine’s extent of inhibition of cytochrome P4503A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. Dependence Liability Fluoxetine has not been systematically studied, in animals or humans, for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of fluoxetine. 19 ADVERSE REACTIONS Commonly Observed In clinical trials, the most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of fluoxetine and not seen at an equivalent incidence among placebo treated patients were: central nervous system complaints, including headache, nervousness, insomnia, drowsiness, fatigue or asthenia, anxiety, tremor, and dizziness or lightheadedness; gastrointestinal complaints, including nausea, diarrhea, dry mouth and anorexia; and excessive sweating. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment Fifteen percent of approximately 4,000 patients who received fluoxetine in North American clinical trials discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. The more common events causing discontinuation from depression trials in adults and elderly, included: psychiatric, primarily nervousness, anxiety, and insomnia; digestive, primarily nausea; nervous system, primarily dizziness, asthenia, and headaches; skin, primarily rash and pruritus. In obsessive compulsive disorder studies, 12.1% of fluoxetine treated patients discontinued treatment early because of adverse events. Anxiety, and rash, at incidences of less than 2%, were the most frequently reported events. In bulimia nervosa studies, 10.2% of fluoxetine treated patients discontinued treatment early because of adverse events. Insomnia, anxiety and rash, at incidences of less than 2%, were the most frequently reported events. Serious Adverse Reactions Suicidal thoughts and acts are far more common among depressed patients than in the general population. It is estimated that suicide is 22 to 36 times more prevalent in depressed persons than in the general population. A comprehensive meta-analysis of pooled data from 17 double blind clinical trials in patients with major depressive disorder compared fluoxetine (n=1765) with a tricyclic antidepressant (n=731) or placebo (n=569), or both. The pooled incidence of emergence of substantial suicidal ideation was 1.2% for fluoxetine, 2.6% for placebo, and 3.6% for tricyclic antidepressants. 20 In countries where the drug has already been marketed, the following potentially serious adverse reactions have been reported; interactions with MAO inhibitors and possibly other drugs, allergic reactions, cardiovascular reactions, syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, and grand mal seizure. Death and life-threatening events have been associated with some of these reactions, although causal relationship to fluoxetine has not necessarily been established. Postmarketing experience also confirms the profile of adverse reactions commonly reported during clinical trials with fluoxetine including allergic skin reactions. Adverse Experience Reports Multiple doses of fluoxetine had been administered to 10,782 patients with various diagnoses in US clinical trials as of May 8, 1995. Adverse events were recorded by clinical investigators using descriptive terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a limited (ie, reduced) number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, COSTART Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The stated frequencies represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. It is important to emphasize that events reported during therapy were not necessarily caused by it. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations 21 involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied. 22 TABLE 1 Percentage of Patients Reporting Event DEPRESSION * (Adults) DEPRESSION (Elderly) OCD* BULIMIA* Fluoxetine (N=1728) Placebo (N=975) Fluoxetine (N=335) Placebo (N=336) Fluoxetine (N=266) Placebo (N=89) Fluoxetine (N=450) Placebo (N=267) -- 14 16 13 12 10 -- 3 1 21 -- 10 11 7 -- -- 8 4 -- 3 -- -- -- -- 3 1 -- 3 -- 2 -- 9 9 6 7 3 -- 0 1 9 -- 7 2 5 -- -- 3 3 -- 4 -- -- -- -- 3 4 -- 2 -- -- 28 12 18 9 13 8 11 -- -- 17 14 7 11 11 7 7 7 -- 13 -- 7 6 3 9 -- 3 -- -- -- -- 24 7 12 6 8 4 10 -- -- 7 9 5 2 5 6 2 3 -- 10 -- 9 6 5 14 -- 7 -- -- -- -- -- 14 28 17 14 9 -- 11 5 26 -- 12 17 10 -- -- 7 6 -- 10 -- -- -- -- 11 5 7 5 7 -- -- 15 22 7 7 1 -- 2 2 13 -- 3 10 4 -- -- 0 3 -- 7 -- -- -- -- 9 2 -- 0 -- -- -- 11 33 13 15 13 -- 5 5 29 -- 9 8 10 -- -- 8 4 -- 8 -- -- -- -- 10 6 11 2 7 7 -- 5 13 5 9 1 -- 1 3 11 -- 6 4 6 -- -- 3 4 -- 3 -- -- -- -- 5 4 -- 1 -- -- Body System/ Adverse Event Nervous System Headache Nervousness Insomnia Somnolence Anxiety Tremor Dizziness Libido, decreased Abnormal dreams Digestive System Nausea Diarrhea Dry mouth Anorexia Dyspepsia Constipation Flatulence Skin and Appendages Sweating Rash Body as a Whole Asthenia Flu syndrome Back Pain Abdominal Pain Myalgia Respiratory System Rhinitis Pharyngitis Sinusitis Yawn Cardiovascular System Vasodilatation Urogenital System Abnormal Ejaculation† Impotence† † Denominator used was for males only (N= 690 fluoxetine depression; N=410 23 placebo depression; N=116 fluoxetine OCD; N=43 placebo OCD; N=14 fluoxetine bulimia; N=1 placebo bulimia). -- Incidence less than 1% * The most common treatment-emergent adverse events associated with the use of fluoxetine (incidence of at least 5% for fluoxetine and at least twice that for placebo within at least one of the indications) for the treatment of depression, OCD, and bulimia in US controlled clinical trials.

Table 3 lists the adverse events associated with discontinuation of fluoxetine treatment (incidence at least twice that for placebo and at least 1% for fluoxetine in clinical trials collecting only a primary event associated with discontinuation) in depression, OCD, and bulimia.

In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance, cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. In patients enrolled in depression, OCD, and bulimia placebo-controlled clinical trials, decreased libido was the only sexual side effect reported by at least 2% of patients taking fluoxetine (4% fluoxetine, < 1 % placebo). There have been spontaneous reports in women taking fluoxetine of orgasmic dysfunction, including anorgasmia. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining 26 sexual dysfunction with fluoxetine treatment. Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Following is a list of all treatment-emergent adverse events reported at anytime by individuals taking fluoxetine in US clinical trials (10,782 patients) except (1) those listed in the body or footnotes of Tables 1 or 2 above or elsewhere in labeling; (2) those for which the COSTART terms were uninformative or misleading; (3) those events for which a causal relationship to fluoxetine use was considered remote; and (4) events occurring in only 1 patient treated with fluoxetine and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in less than 1/100 but at least 1/1,000 patients; rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.

SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE Symptoms Cases of overdose of fluoxetine alone usually have a mild course. Symptoms of overdose included nausea, vomiting, seizures, cardiovascular dysfunction ranging from asymptomatic arrhythmias to cardiac arrest, pulmonary dysfunction, and signs of altered CNS status ranging from excitation to coma. Falalities attributed to overdose of fluoxetine alone have been reported. (Please refer to Human Experience and Animal Experience sections below). Treatment There are no specific antidotes for fluoxetine. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant. Establish and maintain an airway; ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cardiac and vital signs monitoring is recommmended, along with general symptomatic and supportive measures. 31 Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal should be considered in treating overdose. Due to the large volume of distribution of fluoxetine, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. A specific caution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken fluoxetine and might ingest excessive quantities of a TCA. In such a case, accumulation of the parent tricyclic and/or an active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation. Fluoxetine-induced seizures which fail to remit spontaneously may respond to diazepam (see Product Monograph for diazepam). In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control centre on the treatment of any overdosage. Human Experience Worldwide exposure to fluoxetine hydrochloride is estimated to be over 38 million patients (circa 1999). Of the 1578 cases of overdose involving fluoxetine hydrochloride, alone or with other drugs, reported from this population, there were 195 deaths. Among 633 adult patients who overdosed on fluoxetine hydrochloride alone, 34 resulted in a fatal outcome, 378 completely recovered, and 15 patients experienced sequelae after overdosage, including abnormal accomodation, abnormal gait, confusion, unresponsiveness, nervousness, pulmonary dysfunction, vertigo, tremor, elevated blood pressure, impotence, movement disorder, 32 and hypomania. The remaining 206 patients had an unknown outcome. The most commom signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal overdosage were seizures, somnolence, nausea, tachycardia, and vomiting. The largest known ingestion of fluoxetine hydrochloride in adult patients was 8 grams in a patient who tool fluoxetine alone and who subsequently recovered. 33 However, in an adult patient who took fluoxetine alone, an ingestion as low as 520 mg has been associated with lethal outcome, but causality has not been established. Among pediatric patients (ages 3 months to 17 years), there were 156 cases of overdose involving fluoxetine alone or in combination with other drugs. Six patients died, 127 patients completely recovered, 1 patient experienced renal failure, and 22 patients had an unknown outcome. One of the six fatalities was a 9-year-old boy who had a history of OCD, Tourette’s syndrome with tics, attention deficit disorder, and fetal alcohol syndrome. He has been receiving 100 mg of fluoxetine daily for 6 months in addition to clonidine, methylphenidate, and promethazine. Mixed-drug ingestion or other methods of suicide complicated all six overdoses in children that resulted in fatalities. The largest ingestion in pediatric patients was 3 grams which was non-lethal. Other important adverse events reported with fluoxetine overdose (single and multiple drugs) including coma, delirium, ECG abnormalities (such as QT interval prolongation and ventricular tachycardia, including torsades de pointes-type arrhythmias), hypotension, mania, neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like events, pyrexia stupor, and syncope. Animal Experience Studies in animals do not provide precise or necessarily valid information about the treatment of human overdose. However, animal experiments can provide useful insights into possible treatment strategies. The oral median lethal dose in rats and mice was found to be 452 and 248 mg/kg, respectively. Acute high oral doses produced hyper-irritability and convulsions in several animal species. Among six dogs purposely overdosed with oral fluoxetine, five experienced grand mal seizures. Seizures stopped immediately upon the bolus intravenous administration of a standard veterinary dose of diazepam. In this short-term study, the lowest plasma concentration at which a seizure 34 occured was only twice the maximum plasma concentration seen in humans taking 80 mg/day, chronically. In a separate single-dose study, the ECG of dogs given high doses did not reveal prolongation of the PR, QRS, or QT intervals. Tachycardia and an increase in blood pressure were observed. Consequently, the value of the ECG in predicting cardia toxicity is unknown. Nonetheless, the ECG should ordinarily be monitored in cases of human overdose. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Since it may take up to four or five weeks to reach steady-state plasma levels of Dom- FLUOXETINE (fluoxetine), sufficient time should be allowed to elapse before dosage is gradually increased. Higher dosages are usually associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions. DEPRESSION Initial Adult Dosage: The usual initial dosage is 20 mg administered once daily in the morning. A gradual dose increase should be considered only after a trial period of several weeks if the expected clinical improvement does not occur. Dosage should not exceed a maximum of 80 mg per day since clinical experience with doses above 80 mg per day is very limited. Long Term Use: The efficacy of Dom-FLUOXETINE in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 38 weeks following 12 weeks of open-label acute treatment (50 weeks total) was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. The usefulness of the drug in patients receiving Dom- FLUOXETINE for extended periods should be reevaluated periodically (see Clinical Trials). Use in the Elderly: Fluoxetine was in depressed elderly patients evaluated only at a dosage of 20 mg/day. A lower or less frequent dosage may be effective and should be considered in elderly patients with concurrent disease or on multiple medications. 35 Use in Children: The safety and effectiveness of Dom-FLUOXETINE in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. BULIMIA NERVOSA Adult Dosage: The recommended dosage is 60 mg per day, although studies show that lower doses may also be efficacious. Electrolyte levels should be assessed prior to initiation of treatment. OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER A dose range of 20 mg/day to 60 mg/day is recommended for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. For any indication, the total fluoxetine dosage should not exceed a maximum of 80 mg per day since clinical experience with doses above 80 mg per day is very limited. During maintenance therapy, the dosage should be kept at the lowest effective level. A lower or less frequent dosage should be used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment and in those on multiple medications. SWITCHING PATIENTS TO A TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT (TCA) Dosage of a TCA may need to be reduced, and plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored temporarily when fluoxetine is coadministered or has been recently discontinued (see Tricyclic Antidepressants under Drug Interactions). SWITCHING PATIENTS TO OR FROM A MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITOR (MAOI) At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of therapy with Dom-FLUOXETINE. In addition, at least 5 weeks, perhaps longer, should be allowed after stopping Dom-FLUOXETINE before starting MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). 36 Information for the patient: See INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR Dom-FLUOXETINE PRESCRIPTION 37 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION Drug Substance: Proper Name: Fluoxetine hydrochloride Chemical Name: hydrochloride (+)-N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-[(α,α,α-trifluoro-p-tolyl)-oxy]-propylamine Structural Formula: Molecular Formula: C17H18F3NO.HCl Molecular Weight: 345.79 Description: White to off-white crystalline solid.

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT DOM-FLUOXETINE • Dom-FLUOXETINE (fluoxetine hydrochloride) belongs to a group of medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). • Dom-FLUOXETINE has been prescribed by your doctor to relieve your symptoms of depression, bulimia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder WHAT YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE TAKING DOM-FLUOXETINE • all your medical conditions, including a history of liver or kidney problems, seizures or blackouts, or diabetes • any medications (prescription or nonprescription) you are taking or have recently taken, especially monoamine oxidase inhibitor's (e.g., phenelzine sulfate, tranylcypromine sulfate moclobemide or selegeline), any other antidepressants, drugs used to treat diabetes, drugs used to thin the blood (anticoagulants) or drugs containing tryptophan ! any natural or herbal products you are taking ( e.g. St. John’s Wort) • if you are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or if you are breast feeding • your habits of alcohol and /or street drug consumption • if you have ever had an allergic reaction to medication used to treat your current condition • if you drive a vehicle or perform hazardous tasks during your work 41 HOW TO TAKE DOM-FLUOXETINE • It is important that you take Dom-FLUOXETINE exactly as your doctor has instructed. Generally people take between 20 mg to 80 mg per day for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder and between 20 mg and 60 mg per day for bulimia. Your doctor may adjust the dose during the course of your treatment. • Never increase the amount of Dom-FLUOXETINE you are taking unless your doctor tells you to. • You should continue to take your medicine even if you do not feel better, as it may take a number of weeks for your medicine to work. Improvement will be gradual. • Dom-FLUOXETINE is usually taken once a day. It may be taken with or without food. If you are taking capsules, you should swallow the capsules whole; do not chew them. • Keep taking your Dom-FLUOXETINE until the doctor tells you to stop. The doctor may tell you to continue to take your medicine for several months. Continue to follow the doctor's instructions. • If you forget to take a dose of Dom-FLUOXETINE, don't try to make up for it by taking a double dose the next time. Continue with the next scheduled dose ! You should avoid taking St. John’s Wort if you are taking Dom-FLUOXETINE. Remember: This medicine has been prescribed only for you. Do not give it to anybody else. WHEN NOT TO USE DOM-FLUOXETINE • Do not use Dom-FLUOXETINE if you are allergic to it or any of the components of its formulation (see list of components at the end of this section). Stop taking the drug and contact your doctor immediately if you experience an allergic reaction (e.g., skin rash, hives) or any severe or unusual side effects. • Do not use Dom-FLUOXETINE if you are currently taking thioridazine. 42 PRECAUTIONS WHEN TAKING DOM-FLUOXETINE • Although Dom-FLUOXETINE seldom produces severe drowsiness, you should avoid driving a car, or operating hazardous machinery until you are reasonably certain your ability to do so is not affected. SIDE EFFECTS OF DOM-FLUOXETINE • Changes in sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are often associated with psychiatric disorders. However, this medication can cause such undesired sexual experiences. • You may experience other side effects such as nausea, dizziness, headache, anxiety, nervousness, drowsiness, or insomnia. Consult your doctor if you experience these or other side effects, as the dose may have to be adjusted. WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF OVERDOSE • If you have taken a large number of tablets all at once, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital emergency department immediately, even though you may not feel sick.

Serotonin released into the synaptic cleft by a nerve impulse is inactivated principally by reuptake into the presynaptic nerve ending where it is metabolized or retained in storage granules. Fluoxetine specifically inhibits the reuptake process, thereby allowing serotonin to remain longer in the synaptic cleft and enhancing the action of the neurotransmitter on synaptic receptors. Fluoxetine has only weak affinity for various receptor systems in receptor binding studies. A number of behavioral, neuroendocrinologic, and other pharmacologic effects of fluoxetine in experimental animals have been attributed to its enhancement of serotonergic function by inhibition of serotonin uptake. Fluoxetine restored the capacity for acquisition of passive avoidance task in olfactory bulbectomized rats, potentiated 5-hydroxy-tryptophan-induced head twitch in mice, potentiated 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced depression of operant behavior in pigeons, and potentiated the behavioral effect of 5-hydroxytryptophan in rats working on a milk reinforcement schedule. Fluoxetine suppressed REM sleep in rats and cats, and reduced the amount or altered the composition of dietary intake in rats. It also selectively reduced non-protein caloric intake in rats. Few pharmacologic actions of fluoxetine other than inhibition of serotonin uptake and consequences of that inhibition have been found. For instance, fluoxetine does not antagonize reserpine- or apomorphine-induced hypothermia in mice, and does not reduce immobility in the forced swimming test in rats. Pharmacokinetics Fluoxetine was well absorbed orally and the oral bioavailability of fluoxetine in dogs was 72%. In dogs given oral doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg fluoxetine for one year, dose dependent increases in fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations were observed in liver, adrenal, and lung. Norfluoxetine concentrations exceeded fluoxetine concentrations in the tissues, and persisted for a 45 longer period in plasma. In rats, after a single i.p. dose of 10 mg/kg, the plasma half-life of fluoxetine was 26 hours and that of norfluoxetine, 40 hours. The plasma half-life in dogs dosed orally at 5 to 10 mg/kg for 15 days, was 1 day for fluoxetine and 2.1 to 5.4 days for norfluoxetine. In vitro, fluoxetine was N-demethylated to norfluoxetine by rat, guinea pig, and rabbit liver microsomes. In vivo, fluoxetine was metabolized mainly by N-demethylation in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs. The other major metabolite was trifluoro-methylphenol, formed by O- dealkylation, which was excreted as a sulphate or glucuronide conjugate by rats, guinea pigs, and dogs. Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were also excreted in the urine unchanged in guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs. In rats, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were both further metabolized, so that neither fluoxetine nor its N-demethylated metabolite was found in the urine. Rats eliminated 16 to 42 percent of the dose in urine as p-trifluoromethylphenol and 8 percent of the dose as hippuric acid in 24 hours. 46 TOXICOLOGY Acute Toxicity Species Route Sex Fluoxetine LD50 (mg/kg) Norfluoxetine LD50 (mg/kg) Mouse Rat Guinea Pig Cat Dog Monkey Oral I.V.

Subchronic Toxicity Mice (5/sex/dose) were maintained on diets containing ca. 25, 59 and 204 mg/kg/day fluoxetine for 15 days. Thirty and 100% mortality were observed at the middle and high dose, respectively. Significant effects at the two highest doses included: hyperactivity and body weight loss, decrease in spleen weights and phospholipidosis. 47 Mice were maintained for three months on diets equivalent to ca. 2, 7 or 31 mg/kg/day. Significant effects were essentially limited to high dose mice and included 15% mortality; persistent hyperactivity and decreased body weight gain; slight and reversible increases in alkaline phosphatase and alanine transaminase; decreases in testes, heart, and spleen weights; hypospermatogenesis; reversible pulmonary phospholipidosis. Pulmonary histiocytosis (phospholipidosis) was the major pathological finding in rats maintained on diets providing average doses of approximately 9, 25 or 74 mg/kg/day for three months. All animals at ca. 74 mg/kg/day died by week 8. Decreased food consumption, weight loss, and hyperirritability were observed at ca. 25 and 74 mg/kg/day. Dogs given 5 to 50 mg/kg/day orally for two weeks experienced anorexia, mydriasis and vomiting. Dogs, receiving 50 mg/kg/day exhibited ataxia, tremors and a convulsion in one dog. Dogs survived oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day for three months with significant anorexia as the major treatment-related effect. Significant accumulation of both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine occurred in the plasma and tissues. Mydriasis and tremors were observed during the first month. Monkeys given 10 or 25 mg/kg/day p.o. for two weeks exhibited anorexia and weight loss. One monkey at 25 mg/kg/day exhibited clonic convulsions after six doses. Accumulation of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine was observed after multiple dosing and decreased erythrocyte and white blood cell counts were observed. Chronic Toxicity Fluoxetine was given daily to rats (25/sex/dose) for one year at dietary levels of ca. 0.5, 2.3 and 10.7 mg/kg/day. Physical signs of toxicity were limited to females at the high dose level and consisted of anorexia, chromodacryorrhea and an unusual behaviour first noted during the eighth month of treatment in which the animals walked on their toes with feet extended and backs arched after they had been handled. 48 Evidence of phospholipidosis was obtained in the lung, liver and adrenal cortex of 24/40 animals at the high dose level and in one rat at the mid-dose level. Phospholipidosis was reversible after two months' withdrawal from treatment. Minimal to slight fat deposition in the liver was prevalent at the mid and high dose levels. Reversible, minimal reticuloendothelial cell hyperplasia was present in the lymph nodes of the high dose level animals. Dogs (5/sex/dose) received daily oral doses of 1, 4.5, or 20 mg/kg (decreased to 10 mg/kg after 6 months as three females died) of fluoxetine for one year. The toxic effects observed in this study were similar to those of the subchronic study except that phospholipidosis was seen after chronic administration in the lung, liver, adrenals, the inner plexiform layer of the retina, lymph nodes, spleen, and peripheral leukocytes in the animals receiving the high dose. They also showed moderate bradycardia and a moderate decrease in adrenal weight. Phospholipidosis was only observed in the lung and leukocytes in a few of the dogs at the lowest dose level of 1.0 mg/kg/day. No cardiovascular effects were seen apart from a slight decrease in basal heart rate. All treatment-related effects were reversible during the recovery period in surviving animals. Carcinogenicity Rats were maintained for two years at dietary levels equivalent to a time-weighted average dose of ca. 0.45, 2 and 9 mg/kg/day. Age-related observations such as chromodacryorrhea, alopecia, and poor grooming increased at the high dose, especially in females. Weight gain and food consumption were depressed at the high dose and a handling-induced behaviour involving arching of the back and walking on toes was observed primarily in females in this group. Increased tissue levels of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were observed at all doses, and phospholipidosis was observed primarily at the high dose. There were no significant increases in tumor incidence or animal mortality. Mice were fed dietary levels of fluoxetine equivalent to ca. 1.2, 4.8 and 12.1 mg/kg/day. The dietary levels were based on the results of the three-month subchronic study. Unexpectedly, high mortality 49 occurred in females receiving the high dose early in the two-year study, necessitating lowering the dose after 30 days. The survival rate of females receiving the high dose was reduced at two years. No major toxicological effects were seen in mice other than a moderate increase in alanine transaminase in males receiving the high dose and slight changes in organ weights. Hepatocellular degeneration, fat deposition in liver, and centrilobular hepatocellular degeneration were observed microscopically at the median and high dose. There was no evidence of phospholipid accumulation in the lung, and no oncogenic response was observed. A second two-year mouse study using similar doses gave similar results. Survival at two years was reduced in females receiving the high dose. Handling-induced clonic convulsions occurred at all levels in males, and in females, at the high-dose level it was accompanied by a slight increase in liver weight. Minimal-to-moderate fatty change in the liver and hepatocellular cytomegaly were seen in mice from the median- and high-dose levels. There was a dose-dependent increase in concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in lung tissue. There was no evidence of phospholipid accumulation in the lung, and no oncogenic response was observed. Mutagenicity The mutagenicity of fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine was evaluated in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests including Ames test, modified Ames test, DNA repair in rat hepatocytes, sister chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster bone marrow assays, and mouse lymphoma assay. Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were negative in all 5 systems. Teratology Studies Virgin female Fischer 344 rats (25/dose) were bred with untreated control males and were given daily oral (gavage) doses of 2, 5, or 12.5 mg/kg/day fluoxetine on gestation days 6-15; animals were evaluated on gestation day 20. Body weight gains and food consumption were depressed at 12.5 mg/kg/day. Fluoxetine produced no teratogenic effects and no changes in reproductive parameters. 50 Virgin female Dutch Belted rabbits (15/dose) were artificially inseminated with semen from untreated control males and were given daily oral (gavage) doses of 2.5, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg/day fluoxetine on gestation days 6-18; animals were evaluated on gestation day 28. Maternal toxicity was demonstrated by depressed body weight gains and food consumption at all dose levels in a dose- dependent manner. At the 15 mg/kg/day dose, two rabbits died and three aborted. Resorptions were also increased in this group. There was no evidence of a teratogenic effect. Reproductive Studies Female Wistar rats (30/dose) were given daily oral doses of 2, 5, or 12.5 mg/kg from two weeks prior to mating through gestation or lactation. In a second study, male Wistar rats (40/dose) were maintained on diets approximately equivalent to 1.5, 3.9, or 9.7 mg/kg for 10 weeks prior to mating and through the breeding trial. These treated males were mated with female Wistar rats (40/dose) maintained at the same dietary levels for three weeks prior to mating and throughout lactation. In both studies, a depression in neonatal survival was obtained at the high dose level. No teratogenic effects or adverse effects on fertility or post-natal development were associated with fluoxetine administration. Discussion of Phospholipidosis Systemic phospholipidosis was associated with the subchronic and/or chronic administration of fluoxetine to mice, rats and dogs. This effect was associated with the accumulation of norfluoxetine, and to a lesser extent, fluoxetine, in affected tissues. Systemic phospholipidosis was not associated with any adverse effects and was shown to be reversible after the chronic administration of fluoxetine for one year in rats and dogs. This effect has been demonstrated in animals with a number of other clinically useful cationic amphiphilic drugs including antidepressants - imipramine, clomipramine, iprindole and other drugs - chlorphentermine, fenfluramine, clozapine, chloroquine, mepacocine, chlorcyclizine, tamoxifen, 4,4'diethylaminoethoxyhexestrol, amiodarone and perhexiline. The significance of this finding for man is not fully understood. It is anticipated that in the clinical use of fluoxetine, the properties of the drug which are associated with phospholipidosis will not result in any untoward effect. 51 BIBLIOGRAPHY Altamura AC, Montgomery SA, Wernicke JF.

The mechanism of action on the CNS is not completely understood, but methylphenidate is thought to block the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d- and l-isomers. The d-isomer is pharmacologically active; the l-isomer has little pharmacologic activity. Following administration of CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl, plasma concentrations of the l-isomer were approximately 1/40th the plasma concentrations of the d-isomer. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Methylphenidate is readily absorbed. Following oral administration of CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl to adults, plasma methylphenidate concentrations reach an initial maximum at about 1 to 2 hours, then increase gradually over the next several hours. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved at about 6 to 8 hours after CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 2 which a gradual decrease in plasma levels of methylphenidate begins. CONCERTA once daily (q.d.) minimizes the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with multiple doses of immediate-release methylphenidate treatments (see Figure 1). The relative bioavailability of CONCERTA q . d . a n d three times a day is comparable. e t i a d n e h p y h l t e M a m s a P n a e M l n o i t / ) L m g n ( a r t n e c n o C methylphenidate (t.i.d.) in adults CONCERTATM 18 mg qd Methylphenidate 5 mg tid 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 Time (h) Figure 1.

The AUC and t1 /2 following repeated q.d. dosing are similar to those following the first dose of CONCERTA 18 mg. Distribution Plasma methylphenidate concentrations in adults decline biexponentially following oral administration. The half-life of methylphenidate in adults following oral administration of CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl was approximately 3.5 h. In humans, 15 ± 5% of methylphenidate in the blood is bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism and Excretion In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily by de-esterification to alpha-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid (PPA), which has little pharmacologic activity. In adults the metabolism of CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl q.d., as evaluated by metabolism to PPA, is similar to that of methylphenidate t.i.d. The metabolism of single and repeated q.d. doses of CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl is similar. After oral dosing of radio-labelled methylphenidate in humans, about 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. The main urinary metabolite was PPA, accounting for approximately 80% of the dose (see Pharmacokinetics, Special Populations, Renal Insufficiency). Food Effects In patients, there were no differences in either the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamic performance of CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl when administered after a high fat breakfast. There is no evidence of dose dumping in the presence or absence of food. Special Populations In healthy adults, the mean dose-adjusted AUC(0-inf) values for CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl were 36.7 ng·h/mL in men and 37.1 ng·h/mL in women, with no differences noted between the two groups. In adults receiving CONCERTA tablets, dose-adjusted AUC (0-inf) was consistent across ethnic groups; CONPMDFT.pri.wpd however, the sample size may have been insufficient to detect ethnic variations in pharmacokinetics. 5 Renal Insufficiency There is very limited experience with the use of methylphenidate in patients with renal insufficiency. Renal clearance is not significant for methylphenidate elimination, but the main methylphenidate metabolic product, PPA, is predominantly (80%) cleared through the urine. Hepatic Insufficiency There is no experience with the use of CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl in patients with hepatic insufficiency. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 6 Clinical Trials CONCERTA was demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of ADHD in three double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled studies in 416 children six to twelve years old, who met the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illness, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for ADHD. The controlled studies compared CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl q.d. (18, 36, or 54 mg), methylphenidate t.i.d. over 12 hours (15, 30, or 45 mg total daily dose), and placebo in two single-centre, 3-week, crossover studies (Study 1 and Study 2) and in a multicentre, 4-week, parallel-group comparison (Study 3). The primary comparison of interest in all three trials was CONCERTA versus placebo. Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated by community school teachers using the Inattention/Overactivity with Aggression (IOWA) Conners scale. Significant reduction in the Inattention/Overactivity subscale in the treatment group versus the placebo was shown consistently across all three controlled studies for CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl q.d. and methylphenidate t.i.d. (p<0.001). The scores for the placebo- controlled parallel study for all three treatment groups are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2: Mean community school teacher IOWA Conners Inattention/Overactivity scores with CONCERTA q.d. (18, 36, or 54 mg), methylphenidate t.i.d. over 12 hours (15, 30, or 45 mg total daily dose), and placebo. The study involved 4 weeks of parallel-group treatments with a Last Observation Carried Forward analysis for weeks 2 to 4. Data at Week 4 is shown. Error bars represent mean plus standard error of the mean. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 7 In the two crossover controlled studies, symptoms of ADHD were evaluated by laboratory school teachers using the SKAMP (Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn and Pelham) laboratory school rating scale. Significant improvement in attention and behaviour versus placebo was shown consistently across the two studies (p<0.005). Efficacy was maintained through 12 hours after dosing, and the sustained beneficial effects of CONCERTA q.d. therapy seen throughout the laboratory classroom day were comparable in duration to those with methylphenidate t.i.d.

The efficacy of CONCERTA in the treatment of ADHD was demonstrated in three placebo-controlled trials of children aged 6-12 who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD (see ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). A diagnosis of ADHD (DSM-IV) implies the presence of hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms that caused impairment and that were present before age 7 years. The symptoms must be persistent, must be more severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development, must cause clinically significant impairment, eg, in social, academic, or occupational functioning, and must be present in 2 or more settings, eg, school (or work) and at home. The symptoms must not be better accounted for by another mental disorder. For the Inattentive Type, at least 6 of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months: lack of attention to details/careless mistakes, lack of sustained attention, poor listener, failure to follow through on tasks, poor organization, avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort, loses things, easily distracted, forgetful. For the Hyperactive-Impulsive Type, at least 6 of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months: fidgeting/squirming, leaving seat, inappropriate running/climbing, difficulty with quiet activities, “on the go,” excessive talking, blurting answers, can’t wait turn, intrusive. For a Combined Type diagnosis, both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive criteria must be met. Special Diagnostic Considerations The specific etiology of ADHD is unknown, and there is no single diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical but of special psychological, educational, and social resources. Learning may or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the patient and not solely on the presence of the required number of DSM-IV characteristics. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 9 Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program CONCERTA is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for ADHD that may include other measures (psychological, educational, social) for patients with this syndrome. Drug treatment may not be indicated for all patients with this syndrome. Drug treatment is not intended for use in the patient who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or other primary psychiatric disorders, including psychosis. Appropriate educational placement is essential in children and adolescents with this diagnosis and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe drug treatment medication will depend upon the physician’s assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patient’s symptoms. Long-Term Use The effectiveness of CONCERTA for long-term use, ie, for more than 4 weeks has not been systematically evaluated in placebo-controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use CONCERTA for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to Methylphenidate CONCERTA is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to methylphenidate or other components of the product. Agitation CONCERTA is contraindicated in patients with marked anxiety, tension, and agitation, since the drug may aggravate these symptoms. Glaucoma CONCERTA is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 10 Motor and Verbal Tics CONCERTA is contraindicated in patients with motor tics or with a family history or diagnosis of Tourette’s syndrome (verbal tics) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In a long-term uncontrolled study (n = 432 children), the cumulative incidence of new onset of motor and verbal tics was 8.8% after 27 months of treatment with CONCERTA. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors CONCERTA is contraindicated during treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and also within a minimum of 14 days following discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (hypertensive crises may result) (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). WARNINGS Potential for Gastrointestinal Obstruction Because the CONCERTA tablet does not appreciably change in shape in the gastrointestinal tract, CONCERTA should not be administered to patients with preexisting gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, such as small bowel inflammatory disease, “short gut” syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, or Meckel’s diverticulum). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations. There have been very rare reports of obstructive symptoms associated with the use of CONCERTA in patients without known gastrointestinal stricture. Due to the controlled-release design, CONCERTA tablet should only be used in patients who are able to swallow the tablets whole (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, General). Depression CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl should not be used to treat severe depression. Fatigue CONPMDFT.pri.wpd CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl should not be used for the prevention or treatment of normal fatigue 11 states. Long-Term Suppression of Growth Sufficient data on the safety of long-term use of methylphenidate in children are not yet available. Although a causal relationship has not been established, suppression of growth (i.e. weight gain, and/or height) has been reported with the long-term use of stimulants in children. Therefore, patients requiring long-term therapy should be carefully monitored. Patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected should have their treatment interrupted. Psychotic Disorders Clinical experience suggests that administration of methylphenidate may exacerbate symptoms of behaviour disturbance and thought disorder, particularly in psychotic patients. Seizures There is some clinical evidence that methylphenidate may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with a prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in the absence of history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, or suspected seizures, the drug should be discontinued. Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions CONCERTA should be used cautiously in patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. Blood pressure should be monitored at appropriate intervals in patients receiving CONCERTA, especially in patients with hypertension. In the laboratory classroom clinical trials (Studies 1 and 2), both CONCERTA and methylphenidate t.i.d. increased resting pulse by an average of 2-6 bpm and produced average increases of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of approximately 1-4 mm Hg during the day, relative to placebo. Therefore, caution is advised in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.g. those with pre-existing hypertension, heart failure, recent myocardial infarction or hyperthyroidism. Visual Disturbance CONPMDFT.pri.wpd Symptoms of visual disturbances have been encountered in rare cases. Difficulties with accommodation and 12 blurring of vision have been reported. Use in Children Under Six Years of Age CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl should not be used in children under six years, since safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established. Drug Dependence CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl should be given cautiously to patients with a history of drug dependence or alcoholism. Chronic abusive use can lead to marked tolerance and psychological dependence with varying degrees of abnormal behaviour. Frank psychotic episodes can occur, especially with parenteral abuse. Careful supervision is required during withdrawal from abuse since severe depression may occur. Withdrawal following chronic therapeutic use may unmask symptoms of an underlying disorder that may require follow-up. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 13 PRECAUTIONS Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory tests are advised during prolonged therapy. The tests should include, but not limit to, hematologic parameters, including complete blood count, differential and platelet counts, and liver enzymes. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that CONCERTA should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Tablets should not be chewed, divided, or crushed. The medication is contained within a non-absorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate. The tablet shell, along with insoluble core components, is eliminated from the body; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet. Patient information is provided in the INFORMATION FOR THE CONSUMER section of this document. To assure safe and effective use of CONCERTA, the information and instructions provided in the INFORMATION FOR THE CONSUMER section should be discussed with patients. Drug Interactions Because of possible effects on blood pressure, CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl should be used cautiously with pressor agents. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Methylphenidate is contraindicated during treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and also within a minimum of 14 days following discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (hypertensive crises may result). The same precautions apply to CONCERTA (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Inhibition of Drug Metabolism by Methylphenidate Human pharmacologic studies have shown that methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (e.g. phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone) and some antidepressants (tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Downward dose adjustment of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate. It may be necessary to adjust the dosage and monitor plasma drug concentrations (or, in the case of coumarin, coagulation times) when initiating or discontinuing concomitant methylphenidate. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 14 Clonidine Serious adverse events have been reported in concomitant use with clonidine, although no causality for the combination has been established. The safety of using methylphenidate in combination with clonidine or other centrally acting alpha-2 agonists has not been systematically evaluated. Alcohol Alcohol may exacerbate the CNS adverse effect of psychoactive drugs. Therefore, patients undergoing CONCERTA therapy should be advised to avoid alcohol during treatment. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, methylphenidate caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas and, in males only, an increase in hepatoblastomas at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day. This dose is approximately 30 times and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose of CONCERTA on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively. Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumor type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown. Methylphenidate did not cause any increases in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 22 times and 5 times the maximum recommended human dose of CONCERTA on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively. In a 24-week carcinogenicity study in the transgenic mouse strain p53+/-, which is sensitive to genotoxic carcinogens, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. Male and female mice were fed diets containing the same concentration of methylphenidate as in the lifetime carcinogenicity study; the high-dose groups were exposed to 60 to 74 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate. Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay or the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay. Sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased, indicative of a weak clastogenic response, in an in vitro assay in cultured Chinese Hamster CONPMDFT.pri.wpd Ovary cells. Methylphenidate was negative in vivo in males and females in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. 15 Methylphenidate did not impair fertility in male or female mice that were fed diets containing the drug in an 18-week Continuous Breeding study. The study was conducted at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day, approximately 80-fold and 8-fold the highest recommended human dose of CONCERTA on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effect Pregnancy Category C: Methylphenidate has been shown to have teratogenic effects in rabbits when given in doses of 200 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 100 times and 40 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively. A reproduction study in rats revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg/day, approximately 15-fold and 3-fold the maximum recommended human dose of CONCERTA on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively. The approximate plasma exposure to methylphenidate plus its main metabolite PPA in pregnant rats was 2 times that seen in trials in volunteers and patients with the maximum recommended dose of CONCERTA based on the AUC. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether methylphenidate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl should not be administered to a nursing woman unless the anticipated benefits to the mother outweigh the potential hazards to the infant. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl in children under six years have not been established. Long-term effects of methylphenidate in children have not been well-established (see WARNINGS, Long-Term Suppression of Growth). CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 16 CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 17 ADVERSE REACTIONS The premarketing development program for CONCERTA included exposures in a total of 755 participants in clinical trials (469 patients, 286 healthy adult subjects). These participants received CONCERTA 18, 36, and/or 54 mg/day. The 469 patients (ages 6 to 13) were evaluated in three controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3), two uncontrolled clinical studies (including a long-term safety study), and one clinical pharmacology study in children with ADHD. Of the 469 patients in this program, 68 patients treated with CONCERTA in one uncontrolled dose-initiation study were naïve to any pharmacologic therapy for their ADHD. Safety data on all patients are included in the discussion that follows. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, and ECGs. Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and listings that follow, COSTART terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment In a 4-week placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, one CONCERTA-treated patient (0.9%; 1/106), one methylphenidate t.i.d. treated patient (0.9%; 1/107), and one placebo-treated patient (1.0%; 1/99) discontinued due to an adverse event (sadness, emotional lability, and increase in tics, respectively). In uncontrolled studies up to 27 months with CONCERTA, 7.4% (32/432) patients discontinued for adverse events. Those events associated with discontinuation of CONCERTA in more than one patient included the following: twitching (tics, 1.9%), anorexia (loss of appetite, 1.9%), insomnia (1.4%), aggravation reaction (0.7%), headache (0.7%), hostility (0.7%), abdominal pain (0.5%). CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 18 Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among CONCERTA-Treated Patients Table 3 enumerates, for the 4-week placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in children with ADHD at CONCERTA dose of 18, 36, or 54 mg q.d., the incidence of treatments-emergent adverse events. The table includes only those events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with CONCERTA, methylphenidate and placebo-treated patients. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the population studied.

Postmarketing Reports Adverse events reported since market introduction in patients taking CONCERTA include suicide, suicide ideation, emerging psychosis, seizure, dyskinesia, pancreatitis, aplastic anemia, serum sickness, hypoglycemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, transient pancytopenia. The causal relationship between CONCERTA and the emergence of these events has not been established. Adverse Events with Other Methylphenidate HCl Products Nervousness and insomnia are the most common adverse reactions reported with other methylphenidate products. Other reactions include hypersensitivity (including skin rash, urticaria, fever, arthralgia, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme with histopathological findings of necrotizing vasculitis, and thrombocytopenic purpura); anorexia; nausea; dizziness; palpitations; headache; dyskinesia; drowsiness; blood pressure and pulse changes, both up and down; tachycardia; angina; cardiac arrhythmia; abdominal pain; weight loss during prolonged therapy. There have been rare reports of Tourette’s syndrome. Toxic psychosis has been reported. Although a definite causal relationship has not been established, the following have been reported in patients taking this drug: instances of abnormal liver function, ranging from transaminase elevation to hepatic coma; isolated cases of cerebral arteritis and/or occlusion; leukopenia and/or anemia; transient depressed mood; a few instances of scalp hair loss. Very rare reports of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been received, and in most of these, patients were concurrently receiving therapies associated with NMS. In a single report, a ten-year-old boy who had been taking methylphenidate for approximately 18 months experienced an NMS-like event within 45 minutes of ingesting his first dose of venlafaxine. It is uncertain whether this case represented a drug-drug interaction, a response to either drug alone, or some other cause. SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 21 Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms of acute methylphenidate overdosage, resulting principally from overstimulation of the CNS and from excessive sympathomimetic effects, may include the following: vomiting, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, convulsions (may be followed by coma), euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, sweating, flushing, headache, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, mydriasis and dryness of mucous membranes. Recommended Treatment Treatment consists of appropriate supportive measures. The patient must be protected against self-injury and against external stimuli that would aggravate the overstimulation already present. Gastric contents may be evacuated by gastric lavage as indicated. Before performing gastric lavage, control agitation and seizures (if present) and protect the airway. Other measures to detoxify the gut include administration of activated charcoal and a cathartic. Intensive care must be provided to maintain adequate circulation and respiratory exchange; external cooling procedures may be required for hyperpyrexia. Efficacy of peritoneal dialysis or extracorporeal hemodialysis for CONCERTA overdosage has not been established. The prolonged release of methylphenidate from CONCERTA tablets should be considered when treating patients with overdose. Alcohol may induce the production of ethylphenidate. The amount of ethylphenidate production is proportional to the blood alcohol concentration (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Alcohol). As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion, including alcohol, should be considered. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General CONCERTA is administered orally once daily in the morning, with or without food. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 22 CONCERTA tablets must be swallowed whole with liquids, and must not be chewed, divided or crushed. The medication is contained within a non-absorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate. The tablet shell, along with insoluble core components, is eliminated from the body; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice something that looks like a tablet in their stool. Dosage should be individualized according to the needs and responses of the patient. Initial Dose Selection Patients New to Methylphenidate The recommended starting dose of CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl for patients who are not currently taking methylphenidate, or for patients who are on stimulants other than methylphenidate, is 18 mg once daily. Patients Currently Using Methylphenidate The recommended dose of CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl for patients who are currently taking methylphenidate b.i.d., t.i.d., or sustained-release (SR) at doses of 10 to 60 mg/day is provided in Table 4. Dosing recommendations are based on current dose regimen and clinical judgement. Table 4: Recommended Dose Conversion from Methylphenidate Regimens to CONCERTA Previous Methylphenidate Daily Dose 5 mg Methylphenidate b.i.d. or 5 mg Methylphenidate t.i.d. or 20 mg Methylphenidate-SR 10 mg Methylphenidate b.i.d. or 10 mg Methylphenidate t.i.d. or 40 mg Methylphenidate-SR 15 mg Methylphenidate b.i.d. or 15 mg Methylphenidate t.i.d. or 60 mg Methylphenidate-SR Recommended CONCERTA Dose 18 mg q. a.m. 36 mg q. a.m. 54 mg q. a.m. Dose Titration CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 23 Dosage increase may be necessary for appropriate effects on behaviour and attention. The daily dosage may be adjusted in 18-mg increments to a maximum of 54 mg/day, taken once daily in the morning. In general, dosage adjustment may proceed at approximately weekly intervals. Daily dosages above 54 mg are not recommended. Maintenance/Extended Treatment There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to indicate how long the patient with ADHD should be treated with CONCERTA. It is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. The physician who elects to use CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl for extended periods in patients with ADHD should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient with trials off medication to assess the patient’s functioning without pharmacotherapy. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued. Dose Reduction and Discontinuation If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse events occur, the dosage should be reduced or, if necessary, the drug should be discontinued. If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued.

System Components and Performance CONCERTA methylphenidate HCl tablets use osmotic pressure to deliver methylphenidate HCl at a controlled rate. The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. The trilayer core is composed of two drug layers containing the drug and excipients, and a push layer containing osmotically active components. There is a precision-laser drilled orifice on the drug-layer end of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the drug overcoat, which consists of 22% of the drug dose, dissolves within one hour, providing an initial dose of methylphenidate. Water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core. As the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, methylphenidate is released through the orifice. The membrane controls the rate at which water enters the tablet core, which in turn controls drug delivery. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the stool as a tablet shell along with insoluble core components. Stability and Storage Recommendations Store at controlled room temperature (15-30°C). Protect from moisture.

Please read this before you / your child start taking CONCERTA tablets. Remember, this information does not take the place of your doctor’s instructions. If you have any questions about this information or about CONCERTA, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. What is CONCERTA? CONCERTA is a once-a-day treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD. CONCERTA contains the drug methylphenidate, a central nervous system stimulant that has been used to treat ADHD for more than 30 years. CONCERTA is taken by mouth, once each day in the morning. What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder? ADHD has three main types of symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Symptoms of inattention include not paying attention, making careless mistakes, not listening, not finishing tasks, not following directions and being easily distracted. Symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness include fidgeting, talking excessively, running around at inappropriate times and interrupting others. Some patients have more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness while others have more symptoms of inattentiveness. Some patients have all three types of symptoms. Many people have symptoms like these from time to time, but patients with ADHD have these symptoms more than others their age. Symptoms must be present for at least 6 months to be certain of the diagnosis. How does CONCERTA work? Part of the CONCERTA tablet dissolves right after you / your child swallow it in the morning, giving you / your child an initial dose of medication. The rest of the medication is slowly released during the day to keep CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 28 improving the symptoms of ADHD. Methylphenidate, the active ingredient in CONCERTA, helps increase attention and decrease impulsiveness and hyperactivity in patients with ADHD. Who should NOT take CONCERTA? You / Your child should NOT take CONCERTA if: • • • • You / Your child have significant anxiety, tension or agitation because CONCERTA may make these conditions worse. You / Your child are allergic to methylphenidate or any of the other ingredients in CONCERTA. You / Your child have glaucoma, an eye disease. You / Your child have tics or Tourette’s syndrome, or a family history of Tourette’s syndrome. Talk to your doctor if you believe any of these conditions apply to you / your child. How should I / my child take CONCERTA? Do not chew, crush or divide the tablets. Swallow CONCERTA tablets whole with water or other liquids, such as milk or juice. Take CONCERTA once each day in the morning. You / Your child may take CONCERTA before or after you / your child eat. Take the dose prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may adjust the amount of drug you / your child take until it is right for you / your child. From time to time, your doctor may interrupt your / your child’s treatment to check your / your child’s symptoms while you / your child are not taking the drug. What are the possible side effects of CONCERTA? In the clinical studies with patients using CONCERTA, the most common side effects were headache, stomach pain, sleeplessness and decreased appetite. Other side effects seen with methylphenidate, the active ingredient in CONCERTA, include nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, dizziness, nervousness, tics, allergic reactions, increased blood pressure, and abnormal thinking or hallucinations. This is not a complete list of possible side effects. Ask your doctor about other side effects. If you / your child develop any side effect, talk to your doctor. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 29 What must I discuss with my doctor before taking CONCERTA? Talk to your doctor before taking CONCERTA if you / your child: • • • • • • • Are being treated for depression or have symptoms of depression, such as feelings of sadness, worthlessness and hopelessness. Have motion tics (hard-to-control, repeated twitching of any parts of your body) or verbal tics (hard- to-control repeating of sounds or words). Have someone in your family with motion tics, verbal tics, or Tourette’s syndrome. Have abnormal thoughts or visions, hear abnormal sounds, or have been diagnosed with psychosis. Have had seizures (convulsions, epilepsy) or abnormal EEGs (electroencephalograms). Have high blood pressure. Have a narrowing or blockage of your gastrointestinal tract (your esophagus, stomach, or small or large intestine). Tell your doctor immediately if you / your child develop any of the above conditions or symptoms while taking CONCERTA. Can I take CONCERTA with other medicines? Tell your doctor about all medicines that you / your child are taking. Your doctor should decide whether you / your child can take CONCERTA with other medicines. These include: • • • Other medicines that a doctor has prescribed. Medicines that you buy yourself without a prescription. Any herbal remedies that you /your child may be taking. You / Your child should not take CONCERTA with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. While on CONCERTA, do not start taking a new medicine or herbal remedy before checking with your doctor. You should avoid alcoholic drinks while taking CONCERTA. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 30 CONCERTA may change the way your / your child’s body reacts to certain medicines. These include medicines used to treat depression (e.g. amitriptyline, imipramine and fluoxetine), prevent seizures (e.g. phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine and primidone) or prevent blood clots (commonly called “blood thinners,” e.g. warfarin). Your doctor may need to change your / your child’s dose of these medicines if you / your child are taking them with CONCERTA. Other important safety information Abuse of methylphenidate can lead to dependence. Tell your doctor if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol or drugs, or if you are now abusing or dependent on alcohol or drugs. Before taking CONCERTA, tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are nursing a baby. If you take methylphenidate, it may be in your breast milk. Tell your doctor if you / your child have blurred vision when taking CONCERTA. Slower growth (weight gain and/or height) has been reported with long-term use of methylphenidate in children. Your doctor will be carefully watching your child’s height and weight. If you / your child are not growing or gaining weight as your doctor expects, your doctor may stop your / your child’s CONCERTA treatment. Call your doctor immediately if you / your child take more than the amount of CONCERTA prescribed by your doctor. What else should I know about CONCERTA? CONCERTA has not been studied in children under six years of age. The CONCERTA tablet does not dissolve completely after all the drug has been released, and you / your child may sometimes notice it in your / your child’s stool. This is normal. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd CONCERTA may be a part of your / your child’s overall treatment for ADHD. Your doctor may also recommend that you / your child have counselling or other therapy. 31 As with all medicines, never share CONCERTA with anyone else and take only the number of CONCERTA tablets prescribed by your doctor. CONCERTA should be stored in a safe place at room temperature (between 15-30°C). Do not store this medicine in hot, damp or humid places. Keep out of the reach of children. CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 32 PHARMACOLOGY Animal Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Methylphenidate HCl is a sympathomimetic agent classified as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. Its mechanism of action is not entirely understood; however, it blocks the reuptake and enhances the release of dopamine and norepinephrine in the mammalian brain, an effect that increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the synaptic cleft. In vitro radioligand binding studies demonstrate that binding of methylphenidate in the brain is localized to dopamine-rich areas. Methylphenidate releases dopamine from a reserpine-sensitive storage pool and inhibits the catecholamine metabolic enzyme, monoamine oxidase (MAO), in the brain of rats. Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture that comprises of the d- and l-threo stereoisomers. The d-isomer is pharmacologically active; the l-isomer has little pharmacologic activity. In a number of animal models, methylphenidate enhances locomotor activity and induces stereotypic behaviours. Recent clinical findings in ADHD children suggest an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT 1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4) and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action. In laboratory animals, stimulative effects on the cardiovascular system and varied effects on endocrine function have also been reported. Pharmacokinetics Studies primarily in humans and rats, as well as limited information available for mice, dogs, monkeys and other species, demonstrate that methylphenidate is readily absorbed, distributed, metabolized and eliminated regardless of the route of administration. While the kinetic rates for these processes are similar among different species, there are differences in metabolic profiles. Distribution of metabolites differs from that of the unchanged parent material, with most of the material that reaches the brain consisting of the unchanged parent compound. Biotransformation in the gut or first-pass metabolism, or both, are common among the species studied. The primary metabolite in humans and a major metabolite in other species is alpha-phenyl- alpha-(2-piperidyl) acetic acid (PPA), also commonly called ritalinic acid. Pharmacokinetic data showed dose- dependent exposure to methylphenidate and PPA. In the presence of alcohol, an intermediate metabolite, CONPMDFT.pri.wpd ethylphenidate, is produced. The amount of ethylphenidate production is proportional to the blood alcohol concentration. 33 TOXICOLOGY The toxicology program for methylphenidate and the oral controlled-release OROS® methylphenidate dosage form, consists of acute toxicity, long-term toxicity, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity , and other special toxicity studies. Acute Toxicity The acute toxicity of methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH) has been studied primarily in mice and rats, and additionally in rabbits and dogs. Published oral LD50 values for rodents and rabbits range from approximately 190 to 900 mg/kg. The probable cause of death in LD50 studies was excessive central adrenergic stimulation. Clinical signs noted with high doses of methylphenidate in animal acute toxicity studies include agitation and increased motor activity, tremors and convulsions, decreased food consumption and stereotypic behaviours such as licking or gnawing. Long-Term Toxicity Treatment with MPH at repeated high doses has demonstrated transient effects on body weight in rats and mice. The liver was the primary target organ for toxicity in mice and rats, with male mice being the most sensitive showing hepatocellular degeneration. MPH has shown some effects on maturation and estrous cyclicity in neonatal rats; estrous cycles were reversibly affected in older rats. Reversible effects of MPH were seen on skeletal growth in neonatal rats; such effects were not seen in older rats. Endocrine effects of MPH have generally been inconsistent or did not show a dose response. The potential gastrointestinal (GI) effects and systemic toxicity of the OROS® methylphenidate dosage form were evaluated in a study conducted in dogs. Except for excessive salivation, no other treatment-related clinical signs were observed. No treatment-related findings were seen in body or organ weights, physical exams, ophthalmic exams, qualitative food consumption, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, macroscopic exams or histopathologic evaluation of tissues. No treatment-related GI irritation or systemic effects were seen for oral doses up to 72 mg/day for 30 days. Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, methylphenidate caused an increase in CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 34 hepatocellular adenomas and, in males only, an increase in hepatoblastomas at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day. This dose is approximately 30 times and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose of CONCERTA on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively. Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumour type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumours. The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumours, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown. Methylphenidate did not cause any increases in tumours in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 22 times and 5 times the maximum recommended human dose of CONCERTA on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively. In a 24-week carcinogenicity study in the transgenic mouse strain p53+/-, which is sensitive to genotoxic carcinogens, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. Male and female mice were fed diets containing the same concentration of methylphenidate as in the lifetime carcinogenicity study; the high-dose groups were exposed to 60 to 74 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate. Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay or the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay. Sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased, indicative of a weak clastogenic response, in an in vitro assay in cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Methylphenidate was negative in vivo in males and females in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity Studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits to evaluate the potential reproductive and developmental toxicity of MPH. Rats appear to be a better animal model than rabbits for developmental/reproductive studies of MPH, based on plasma AUC ratios of drug:metabolite. Reproductive toxicity was studied using a Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding (RACB) protocol or Sperm Morphology Vaginal Cytology Evaluations (SMVCE) endpoints to assess male and female reproductive functions. Methylphenidate did not impair fertility in male or female mice that were fed diets containing the drug in an 18-week Continuous Breeding study. The study was conducted at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day, approximately 80-fold and 8-fold the highest recommended human dose of CONPMDFT.pri.wpd 35 CONCERTA on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively. A perinatal and postnatal development study with neurobehavioural assessments in rats indicated slight developmental delay and marginal alterations in neuromotor performance in offspring of the high-dose dams treated with 30 mg/kg/d MPH (approximately 15 and 3 times the maximum recommended daily human dose for CONCERTA tablets [54 mg MPH] on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively). No effects on learning and memory were seen in offspring and no adverse effects were noted in offspring of dams treated with MPH doses of 12.5 mg/kg/d and lower. A teratology study conducted in rats supports the conclusion that MPH is not a developmental toxicant at the dose levels tested, up to 30 mg/kg/d. The maternal no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of MPH was 5 mg/kg/d. No adverse effects on embryo/fetal viability, growth or malformations were seen. The developmental toxicity NOAEL of MPH was at least 30 mg/kg/d. In a study conducted in rabbits, methylphenidate was shown to have teratogenic effects when given in doses of 200 mg/kg/d, which is approximately 100 times and 40 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis, respectively. Other Special Toxicity Studies Five system transit and drug release studies conducted with the OROS® methylphenidate dosage form in dogs showed no unexpected clinical signs during transit through the gastroinstestinal (GI) tract. Membrane shells remained intact during GI transit with cumulative release of active ingredient generally comparable in vitro and in vivo. Cellular toxicity profile of MPH and effects of MPH on mitochondrial function were evaluated in vitro using an MTT (3-[4,5-dimethythiazole-2-yl]-2,5-di-phenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Results demonstrated that MPH in cell culture medium, at approximate concentrations of 0.125 and 0.25 mg/mL, was noncytotoxic to L-929 mouse fibroblast cells.

PRODUCT MONOGRAPH NAME OF DRUG CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) Tablets, 10, 20 and 40 mg THERAPEUTIC CLASSIFICATION Lipid Metabolism Regulator ACTIONS AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure lipid-lowering agent. It is a selective, potent and competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG- CoA to mevalonate, which is an early and rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Studies have shown that CRESTOR lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver by increasing the number of hepatic Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on the cell-surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL. Additionally, CRESTOR inhibits the hepatic synthesis of Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), thereby reducing the total number of VLDL and LDL particles. Epidemiologic, clinical and experimental studies have established that high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), low High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) and high plasma triglycerides (TG) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developing COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 2 - cardiovascular disease. Some studies have also shown that the total cholesterol (TC):HDL-C ratio (TC:HDL-C) is the best predictor of coronary artery disease. In contrast, increased levels of HDL-C are associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. Drug therapies that reduce levels of LDL-C or decrease TG while simultaneously increasing HDL-C have demonstrated reductions in rates of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Pharmacokinetics CRESTOR is administered orally following which rosuvastatin, the active moiety, is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentration 3 to 5 hours after dosing. Both peak concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increase in proportion to rosuvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20% and there is no accumulation on repeated dosing. CRESTOR may be given with or without food. Administration in the morning or evening did not affect the rate and extent of absorption nor the ability of rosuvastatin to reduce LDL-C. Rosuvastatin undergoes first pass extraction in the liver which is the primary site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL-C clearance. The mean volume of distribution at steady- state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 litres. Rosuvastatin is approximately 90% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations. Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized with approximately 90% of a radiolabeled dose recovered as the parent compound. The major metabolite is N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 2C9, and in in vitro studies has demonstrated to have approximately one-half the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity of rosuvastatin. Following an oral dose, rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces (90%) with the remainder being excreted in the urine. Fecal recovery represents absorbed drug, metabolites in the bile, and unabsorbed drug. The elimination half-life COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 3 - (t½) of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours and does not increase with increasing doses. INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) is indicated as an adjunct to diet, at least equivalent to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III TLC diet), for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, ApoB, the total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio and triglycerides and for increasing HDL-C; in hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions, when response to diet and exercise alone has been inadequate including: P Primary hypercholesterolemia (Type IIa including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and severe non-familial hypercholesterolemia) P Combined (mixed) dyslipidemia (Type IIb) P Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia where CRESTOR is used either alone or as an adjunct to diet and other lipid lowering treatment such as apheresis CRESTOR is contraindicated: CONTRAINDICATIONS P In patients with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. P In patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases exceeding 3 times the upper limit of normal (see WARNINGS). P In pregnant and nursing women (see PRECAUTIONS). P In patients using concomitant cyclosporine (see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions) COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 4 - WARNINGS Hepatic Effects CRESTOR is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases exceeding 3 times the upper limit of normal. As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, it is recommended that a liver function test be carried out prior to, and 3 months following, the initiation of CRESTOR or if the patient is titrated to the dose of 40 mg. CRESTOR should be discontinued or the dose reduced if the level of transaminases is greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, a dose-related increase in transaminases has been observed in a small number of patients taking rosuvastatin (<0.5%); the majority of cases were mild, asymptomatic and transient. Muscle Effects Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than ten times the upper limit of normal, should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if associated with malaise or fever. Patients who develop any signs or symptoms suggestive of myopathy should have their CPK levels measured. CRESTOR therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels (>10 x ULN) occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, effects on skeletal muscle (e.g. uncomplicated myalgia and myopathy) have been reported in patients treated with CRESTOR 10-40 mg. COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 5 - In CRESTOR trials there was no evidence of increased skeletal muscle effects when CRESTOR was dosed with concomitant therapy such as fibric acid derivatives (including fenofibrate and gemfibrozil), nicotinic acid, azole antifungals and macrolide antibiotics. However, an increase in the incidence of myositis and myopathy has been seen in patients receiving other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors together with these medicines. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in subjects receiving rosuvastatin 80 mg in investigational clinical trials, which were occasionally associated with impairment of renal function. All cases improved on cessation of therapy. CRESTOR therapy should be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g. sepsis, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic endocrine and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures. PRECAUTIONS General Before instituting therapy with CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium), an attempt should be made to control hypercholesterolemia with appropriate diet, exercise, weight reduction in overweight patients, and to treat other underlying medical problems and associated cardiovascular risk factors. The patient should be advised to inform subsequent physicians of the prior use of CRESTOR or any other lipid-lowering agent. Hypersensitivity An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported rarely with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. This has included one or more of the following features: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematous-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increase, eosinophilia, arthritis, arthralgia, urticaria, asthenia, photosensitivity, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme including COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 6 - Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Treatment should be discontinued if hypersensitivity is suspected (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Co-enzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) Ubiquinone levels were not measured in CRESTOR clinical trials. Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins has been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure (see BIBLIOGRAPHY). Lipoprotein (a) In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [LP(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high LP(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy. Hepatic Impairment In subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment there was no evidence of increased exposure to rosuvastatin other than in 2 subjects with the most severe liver disease (Child-Pugh scores of 8 and 9). In these subjects, systemic exposure was increased by at least 2-fold compared to subjects with lower Child-Pugh scores (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Renal Impairment In subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, mild to moderate renal disease had little influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. However, subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl<30 mL/min1.73m2) had a 3-fold increase in plasma concentration of rosuvastatin compared to healthy volunteers (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 7 - Use in Pregnancy CRESTOR is contraindicated during pregnancy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterol and other products of cholesterol biosynthesis are essential components for fetal development (including synthesis of steroids and cell membranes). There is no data on the use of CRESTOR during pregnancy. CRESTOR should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking CRESTOR, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Use in Nursing Mothers It is not known whether rosuvastatin is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking CRESTOR should not breast-feed (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Use in Children Treatment experience with CRESTOR in a pediatric population is limited to 8 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. None of these patients was below 8 years of age (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Use in Elderly Treatment experience indicates that safety and efficacy do not vary as a function of age or gender. Additionally, there were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences between young and elderly patients (=65 years) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Endocrine Function HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 8 - production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In CRESTOR treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Patients treated with rosuvastatin who develop clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction should be evaluated appropriately. Caution should be exercised if an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or other agent used to lower cholesterol levels is administered to patients receiving other drugs (e.g. ketoconazole, spironolactone or cimetidine) that may decrease the levels of endogenous steroid hormones. Drug Interactions Concomitant Therapy with Other Lipid Metabolism Regulators Combined drug therapy should be approached with caution as information from controlled studies using CRESTOR is limited. Bile Acid Sequestrants CRESTOR can be used in combination with a bile acid sequestrant (e.g. cholestyramine). Fibric Acid Derivatives (Fenofibrate, Gemfibrozil) and Niacin Co-administration of fenofibrate and CRESTOR 10 mg did not lead to a clinically significant change in the plasma concentrations of either drug. In addition, neither myopathy nor marked CPK elevations (>10 x ULN) were observed in a study of 128 patients who received CRESTOR 10, 20 and 40 mg plus extended-release niacin or in a second study of 103 patients who received CRESTOR 5 and10 mg plus fenofibrate. CRESTOR has been shown to have additive efficacy when used in combination with fenofibrate and niacin. COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 9 - Increased systemic exposure to rosuvastatin has been observed in subjects taking concomitant CRESTOR and gemfibrozil. Co-administration of a single CRESTOR dose (10 mg) to healthy volunteers on gemfibrozil (600 mg bid) resulted in a 2-fold increase in rosuvastatin systemic exposure. Patients taking this combination should start therapy with CRESTOR 10 mg once daily and should not exceed a dose of CRESTOR 20 mg once daily. Myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, has occurred in patients who were receiving co- administration of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with fibric acid derivatives (including gemfibrozil) and niacin. The benefits and risks of such combined therapy should be carefully considered (see WARNINGS, Muscle Effects). Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors In vitro and in vivo data indicate that CRESTOR is not an inhibitor or an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Consequently, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions upon co-administration with agents that are metabolized by cytochrome P450. Since metabolism is only a minor route of clearance for CRESTOR, there is also little potential for drug-drug interactions upon co-administration with compounds which are potent inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450. Ketoconazole Coadministration of ketoconazole with CRESTOR resulted in no change in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. Erythromycin Coadministration of erythromycin with CRESTOR resulted in small decreases in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. These reductions were not considered clinically significant. Itraconazole Coadministration of itraconazole with CRESTOR resulted in a 28% increase in the AUC of rosuvastatin. This small increase was not considered clinically significant. COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 10 - Fluconazole Coadministration of fluconazole with CRESTOR resulted in a 14% increase in the AUC of rosuvastatin. This small increase was not considered clinically significant. Coumarin Anticoagulants As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, coadministration of CRESTOR and coumarin (e.g. warfarin) may result in a rise in INR compared to coumarin alone. In healthy subjects, the coadministration of rosuvastatin 40 mg (10 days) and warfarin 25 mg (single dose) produced a higher mean maxINR and AUC-INR than achieved with warfarin alone. Coadministration of CRESTOR 10 and 80 mg to patients on stable warfarin therapy resulted in clinically significant rises in INR (>4, baseline 2-3). The mechanism for this effect is unknown, but is likely due to a pharmacodynamic interaction with warfarin rather than a pharmacokinetic interaction as no relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of either drug was observed. In patients taking coumarin, monitoring of INR is recommended at initiation or cessation of therapy with rosuvastatin or following dose adjustment. Rosuvastatin therapy has not been associated with bleeding or changes in INR in patients not taking anticoagulants. Antacids Simultaneous dosing of CRESTOR with an antacid suspension containing aluminum and magnesium hydroxide resulted in a decrease of rosuvastatin plasma concentration by approximately 50%. The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been studied. However, the effect was mitigated when the antacid was dosed 2 hours after CRESTOR. This interaction should not be clinically relevant in patients using this type of antacid infrequently. A frequent antacid user should be instructed to take CRESTOR at a time of day when they are less likely to need the antacid. Oral Contraceptives When CRESTOR 40 mg was coadministered with a representative oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol [35 µg] and norgestrel [180 µg on days 1 to 7, 215 µg on days 8 to 15, and 250 µg on days 16 to 21]) no reduction in contraceptive efficacy was observed. An increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) of ethinyl estradiol (26%) and norgestrel COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 11 - (34%) occurred. These increased plasma levels should be considered when selecting oral contraceptive doses. Digoxin Coadministration of digoxin and CRESTOR did not lead to any clinically significant interactions. Immunosuppressants CRESTOR 10 and 20 mg were administered to cardiac transplant patients (at least 6 months post-transplant) whose concomitant medication included cyclosporine, prednisone and azathioprine. Results showed that cyclosporine pharmacokinetics were not affected by rosuvastatin. However, cyclosporine did increase the systemic exposure of rosuvastatin by 10-fold (Cmax) and 7-fold (AUC (0-24)) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Other Drugs Although specific interaction studies were not performed, CRESTOR has been studied in over 5300 patients in clinical trials. Many patients were receiving a variety of medications including antihypertensive agents (beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics), antidiabetic agents (biguanides, sulfonylureas, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones), and hormone replacement therapy without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions In CRESTOR clinical trials there was no evidence of increased skeletal muscle effects when rosuvastatin was dosed with any concomitant therapy. However, all HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may elevate serum transaminase and CPK levels. An increase in the incidence of myositis and myopathy has been seen in patients receiving other HMG- CoA reductase inhibitors with cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives (including gemfibrozil), nicotinic acid, azole antifungals and macrolide antibiotics. COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 12 - As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, a dose-related increase in liver transaminases and CPK has been observed in a small number of patients taking rosuvastatin. Abnormal urinalysis testing (dipstick-positive proteinuria) has been seen in a small number of patients taking CRESTOR and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The protein detected was mostly tubular in origin. In most cases, proteinuria decreases or disappears spontaneously on continued therapy, and is not predictive of acute or progressive renal disease. ADVERSE REACTIONS CRESTOR clinical trial experience is extensive, involving 1290 patients within placebo controlled trials (768 of which were treated with rosuvastatin) and 11641 patients within controlled clinical trials (5319 of which were treated with rosuvastatin). Associated adverse events occurring at an incidence >2% in patients participating in placebo-controlled clinical studies of rosuvastatin, are shown in Table 1.

Rare (0.01% - 0.1%) Myopathy - 13 - The following additional adverse events were reported in controlled clinical trials, regardless of causality: Accidental injury, back, chest and general pain, flu syndrome, infection, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, flatulence, gastroenteritis, dyspepsia, hypertonia, insomnia, paresthesia, bronchitis, increased cough, rhinitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis and rash. In controlled clinical trials, 3.2% of patients were withdrawn from CRESTOR therapy due to adverse events. This withdrawal rate was comparable to that reported in placebo-controlled studies. In long-term controlled clinical trials CRESTOR was shown to have no harmful effect on the ocular lens. SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE There is no specific treatment in the event of overdosage. Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of rosuvastatin. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patients should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet (at least equivalent to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III TLC diet)) before receiving CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium), and should continue on this diet during treatment with CRESTOR. If appropriate, a program of weight control and physical exercise should be implemented. Prior to initiating therapy with CRESTOR, secondary causes for elevations in plasma lipid levels should be excluded. A lipid profile should also be performed. The usual initial dose of CRESTOR is 10 mg orally once a day. CRESTOR may be taken in the morning or evening, with or without food. The majority of patients are COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 14 - controlled at the 10 mg dose. However, if necessary, dose adjustment to 20 mg once daily can be made after 2 weeks. The maximum response is usually achieved within 2-4 weeks and is maintained during chronic therapy. For patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (including those with familial hypercholesterolemia), a 20 mg start dose may be considered. A dose of 40 mg once daily should only be used in those patients who do not achieve their treatment goal on 20 mg. The dosage of CRESTOR should be individualized according to baseline LDL-C, total-C/HDL-C ratio and/or TG levels, the recommended target lipid values (see Recommendations for the Management and Treatment of Dyslipidemia [Canada] (summarized below in Table 2), and/or the Third Report of the U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP Adult Treatment Panel III]) and the patient response. Lipid levels should be monitored periodically and, if necessary, the dose of CRESTOR adjusted based on target lipid levels recommended by guidelines.

It is intended as additional information and does not replace your doctor's or pharmacist's advice. Be sure to follow their advice. If you have any questions about CRESTOR, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Do not decide on your own how to take CRESTOR. ABOUT CRESTOR TABLETS Your doctor has prescribed these tablets (sometimes known as \"statins\") to treat raised or high levels of fatty substances in the blood, called lipids (mainly cholesterol and triglycerides). CRESTOR is just part of the treatment for lowering your lipids. There are many other things you can do, depending on your health and lifestyle, to help lower bad cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) and increase good cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol). Your doctor may recommend: P a change in your diet to control your weight and/or lower your cholesterol. P exercise that is right for you. P quitting smoking and avoiding smoky places. P giving up alcohol or drinking less. Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully and be sure to talk to him/her before changing your diet, starting any exercise program or planning to take any new medication including over-the-counter medicines and diet ‘supplements’. HOW DOES CRESTOR WORK? CRESTOR belongs to a group of drugs called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (also known as statins). HMG-CoA reductase is an enzyme involved in the regulation of lipids in the body. CRESTOR is usually used along with changes to diet and exercise to reduce the levels of lipids in the blood. If high lipid levels are left untreated, they can build up in the walls of the vessels carrying blood around the body which, over time, can lead to narrowing of these vessels. This disease is called atherosclerosis and is one of the most common causes of heart disease. COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 19 - CRESTOR is the brand name for rosuvastatin and is marketed by AstraZeneca Canada Inc. It is only available by prescription from your doctor. BEFORE YOU START CRESTOR Some people should not take CRESTOR. Talk to your doctor if you: P have liver disease. P are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or think you might be pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking CRESTOR, stop taking it and tell your doctor right away. P are breast-feeding. P have taken any \"statin\" medicines before, and had a reaction. P have ever had a reaction to any component of this medication. P are taking cyclosporine (used, for example, after organ transplant). Before taking your CRESTOR tablets, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you: P have ever been told that you have problems with your liver or kidneys. P have any unexplained aches or pains in your muscles. P regularly drink large amounts of alcohol. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medications, including any that you may have bought over-the-counter including diet ‘supplements’. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following: P gemfibrozil (used to lower blood lipids). P warfarin (or any other drug for thinning the blood). HOW TO USE THIS MEDICINE High lipid levels may not make you feel or look sick so it is easy to forget you have high lipids. Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully and keep taking your medicine even if you feel well. Your doctor will watch your lipid levels over time to lower them to a safe range. Below are some tips to help you use your medication properly. P Follow the plan that you and your doctor make for diet, exercise and weight control. P Swallow each tablet whole with a drink of water. Take CRESTOR as a single dose. It does not matter if you take it with or without food, in the morning or evening. Remember to take CRESTOR at the same time every day. P If you miss taking a tablet, take it as soon as you can. But if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and just take the next dose. Do not take a double dose. P Don't change the dose or stop taking the medicine without first talking to your doctor. P If you get sick, have an operation, or need medical treatment while you are taking CRESTOR, let the doctor or pharmacist know that you are taking CRESTOR.

Mississauga, Ontario L4Y 1M4 03/03 COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 22 - PHARMACOLOGY Human Pharmacology CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) decreases elevated total cholesterol (total-C), LDL-C, TG and increases HDL-C in patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In these patients CRESTOR also lowers apolipoprotein B, nonHDL-C, VLDL-C, VLDL-TG, the LDL-C/HDL-C, total- C/HDL-C, nonHDL-C/HDL-C, Apo B/Apo A-I ratios and increases Apo A-I. A therapeutic response to CRESTOR is evident within 1 week after initiation of therapy and 90% of the maximum response is usually obtained after 2 weeks. The maximum response is generally attained in 4 weeks and has been maintained in clinical trial patients followed-up for up to 1 year. Clinical Studies The lowering of total cholesterol, LDL-C and ApoB have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Mortality and morbidity studies with CRESTOR have not yet been completed. CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) has been shown to significantly improve lipid profiles in a variety of dyslipidemic conditions. CRESTOR is highly effective in reducing total and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B and increasing HDL in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (with and without hypertriglyceridemia), familial and non-familial hypercholesterolemia, and mixed hyperlipidemia, and in patients with non- insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). CRESTOR also lowers the LDL-C/HDL- C, total C/HDL-C, nonHDL-C/HDL-C and the ApoB/ApoA-I ratios. Study results have shown that the majority of patients with type IIa and IIb hypercholesterolemia, treated with CRESTOR, achieved recognized treatment guideline (e.g., NCEP-ATP III and Canadian) targets. Fifty-five, seventy-five, ninety-nine and ninety-eight percent of patients (very high, high, medium and low risk COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 23 - categories), entering trials with LDL-C levels between 4.1 to 6.5 mmol/L, reached Canadian target LDL-C levels at week 12 of treatment with CRESTOR 10 mg. Dose-Ranging Studies In clinical trials, CRESTOR (10 to 40 mg/day) corrected lipid abnormalities in a wide variety of hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions. In one multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose range study in patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb), CRESTOR (given as a single daily dose for 6 weeks) significantly reduced the levels of total cholesterol (36-46%), LDL-C (52-63%), TC/HDL-C (43-51%), Apo B (42-54%), TG (10-28%), and increased HDL-C levels (8-14%) across the dose range. Approximately 60% of the LDL-C reduction at 6 weeks was attained within 1 week and 90% of the LDL-C reduction was attained within the first 2 weeks after the beginning of therapy. Animal Pharmacology Rosuvastatin was shown to be an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase in microsomes isolated from rat and human liver. Like other statins, the inhibition was competitive with HMG-CoA and non-competitive with NADPH. Using a cloned fragment of human HMG- CoA reductase, representing the catalytic domain, the estimated inhibition constant (Ki) for rosuvastatin was 0.1 nM. Inhibition of the catalytic domain was also found to be competitive with HMG-CoA and non-competitive with NADPH. Of the metabolites of rosuvastatin that have been detected in humans and animal species, only N-desmethyl rosuvastatin demonstrated notable inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and was found to be 2 to 7-fold less potent than the parent compound. Using primary preparations of hepatocytes, rosuvastatin was found to inhibit cholesterol synthesis from acetate, with an IC50 about 7-fold lower than the nearest comparator, atorvastatin and 40-fold lower than pravastatin. Rosuvastatin did not inhibit synthesis of cholesterol from mevalonate (the product of HMG-CoA reductase), indicating no effect on the enzymes of the sterol pathway downstream from HMG-CoA reductase. Compared to a variety of non-hepatic cells including human myoblasts, rosuvastatin was found to be highly selective for action in hepatocytes. Studies of the initial uptake COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 24 - rates of rosuvastatin into rat hepatocytes defined a high affinity component of uptake with a Km of 9 mM. In addition, compared to other statins, rosuvastatin exhibited low rates of metabolism by Cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes. The comparatively high potency of effect of rosuvastatin in hepatocytes may result from a combination of high affinity for the enzyme active site, active transport, and low rates of metabolism. The high degree of selectivity for action of the compound in liver cells is consistent with its octanol:water partition and with evidence of active transport into hepatocytes. Rosuvastatin was shown to inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis after oral administration to the rat, with 50 to 80% inhibition of liver HMG-CoA reductase achieved at doses between 1 and 5 mg/kg. The uptake of rosuvastatin from plasma was higher into liver than any other tissue and the peak of inhibition in liver after oral dosing coincided with the peak of plasma rosuvastatin levels. There was evidence of a relatively long duration of action on liver cholesterol synthesis by rosuvastatin compared with other statins. In the dog, plasma mevalonate levels were rapidly reduced after oral administration of rosuvastatin. The dose required for half maximal reduction of mevalonate measured at 4 hours post-dose, was similar to the dose required to inhibit hepatic cholesterol by 50% in the rat. When 3 mg/kg was administered to dogs once daily for 14 days, rosuvastatin progressively reduced total cholesterol levels by up to 26%. Stable cholesterol-lowering effects were also observed on oral administration of doses of 0.03 to 0.1 mg/kg of rosuvastatin to the dog for three months. In addition, rosuvastatin has been shown to reduce serum cholesterol and lipoprotein levels in the Cynomolgus monkey. Rosuvastatin dose-dependently reduced VLDL and LDL in two strains of hyperlipidemic transgenic mice and reduced VLDL production rates. In the genetically hyperlipidemic WHHL rabbit, rosuvastatin reduced total and LDL-cholesterol and reduced the extent and degree of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. The effects of rosuvastatin observed in vitro and in the animal models are consistent with inhibition of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase as the primary mode of action. COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 25 - TOXICOLOGY Acute Toxicity Rosuvastatin was shown to be of low acute toxicity following administration of single doses to rats and dogs by oral and intravenous routes. There were no mortalities in rats given an oral dose of 1000 mg/kg or 2000 mg/kg, and other than depression of bodyweight at 2000 mg/kg, there were no treatment-related effects at either dose level. Dogs received oral doses of 1000 mg/kg or 2000 mg/kg with vomiting on the day of dosing observed as the major clinical finding in both sexes. Biochemical changes (increased plasma enzymes, decreased lipids) and hematological change (increased white blood cells) were found in dogs given an oral dose of up to and including 2000 mg/kg. Lethality was observed immediately after dosing in 1/1 of rats given an intravenous dose of 500 mg/kg but two rats given 250 mg/kg intravenously showed slight hypopnea and weakness soon after dosing with no subsequent effects. The results are summarized below: Table 4: Species Rat Rat Rat Dog Acute Oral and Intravenous Toxicity Studies with Rosuvastatin Route Oral Dose Levels for One or Both Sexes (mg/kg) 1000 and 2000 Intravenous 250 and 500 Oral Oral 1000 and 2000 1000 and 2000 Mortalities 0/1 at 1000 mg/kg; 0/2 at 2000 mg/kg 1/1 died at 500 mg/kg; 0/2 at 250 mg/kg 0/12 at 1000 mg/kg; 0/12 at 2000 mg/kg 0/2 at 1000 mg/kg; 0/2 at 2000 mg/kg Subacute and Chronic Toxicity The significant target organs affected by rosuvastatin in multiple dose toxicity studies in rats (14 days to 6 months), mice (2 weeks to 13 weeks), Cynomolgus monkeys (30 days to 6 months), dogs (14 days to 12 months) and rabbits (developmental toxicity study) are summarized in Table 5 below.

Carcinogenicity/Mutagenicity In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 2, 20, 60 or 80 mg/kg/day, the incidence of uterine polyps was statistically significantly increased only in females at COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 28 - the dose of 80 mg/kg/day. This dose produced a plasma AUC (0-24) value approximately 8 times higher (after correction for interspecies differences in protein binding) than the human plasma drug exposure after a 40 mg dose at steady-state. Increased incidences of polyps observed at 2, 20 and 60 mg/kg/day were not statistically different from the control group not exposed to rosuvastatin. The 60 mg/kg/day dose produced a plasma AUC (0-24) value approximately 5 times higher (after correction for interspecies differences in protein binding) than the mean human exposure after a 40 mg dose at steady-state. The occurrence of uterine polyps in old female rats is well-known and are considered benign tumors and lesions termed non- neoplastic in humans. In a 107-week carcinogenicity study in mice given 10, 60, 200 or 400 mg/kg/day, the 400 mg/kg/day dose was poorly tolerated, resulting in early termination of this dose group. An increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was observed at 200 mg/kg/day and an increase in hepatocellular adenomas was seen at 60 and 200 mg/kg/day. The dose of 200 mg/kg/day produced a plasma AUC (0-24) value approximately 37 times higher (after correction for interspecies differences in protein binding) than the mean human plasma drug exposure after a 40 mg dose at steady- state. An increased incidence of hepatocellular tumors was not seen at 10 mg/kg/day. The 60 mg/kg/day dose produced a plasma AUC (0-24) value approximately 4.9 times higher (after correction for interspecies differences in protein binding) than the mean human plasma drug exposure after a 40 mg dose at steady-state. These hepatocellular effects are known to occur in rodents treated with statins without evidence of similar effects in humans. In vitro, rosuvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, L-5178 y± mouse lymphomas, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Rosuvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 29 - Teratology and Reproductive Studies The reproductive toxicity of rosuvastatin has been evaluated in fertility and pre- and post-natal developmental studies, at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day. Slight reductions in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at 50 mg/kg/day. Rosuvastatin had no adverse effects on mating, fertility in both sexes, implantation and maintenance of pregnancy, pup morphology or survival at 50 mg/kg/day in the fertility study. In a pre- and post-natal sighting study in rats given #75 mg/kg/day there was reduced pup survival at birth at 125 and 150 mg/kg/day and during early lactation at 75 and 100 mg/kg/day. In the main pre- and post-natal developmental study, rosuvastatin showed no adverse effects on the duration of pregnancy, delivery and lactation in the dams in either generation at the high dose of 50 mg/kg/day. In the absence of plasma AUC exposure data in pregnant rats, comparisons with human data have been made on a received dose basis. The dose of 50 mg/kg/day equates to 90 times the human dose of 40 mg given to a 70 kg human. The potential of rosuvastatin to cause developmental toxicity has been examined in the pregnant rat at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, and in the pregnant rabbit at doses up to 3 mg/kg/day. Rosuvastatin was shown to be neither embryo-fetolethal nor teratogenic in rats. At a maternally toxic dose of 3 mg/kg/day in rabbits, fetal examination showed no evidence of fetolethality or teratogenicity. Overall, rosuvastatin has shown no reproductive or developmental toxicity. COPYRIGHT 2003 ASTRAZENECA CANADA INC. - 30 - BIBLIOGRAPHY Cooper KJ, Martin PD, Dane AL et al.

Propafenone has a direct stabilizing action on myocardial cell membranes. The electrophysiological effect of propafenone manifests itself as a reduction of the upstroke velocity (Phase 0) of the monophasic action potential, while phase 4 spontaneous automaticity is depressed. Diastolic excitability threshold is increased and effective refractory period prolonged. In Purkinje fibers, and to a lesser extent myocardial fibers, propafenone reduces the fast inward sodium current. In addition to a local anesthetic effect, approximately equal to procaine, propafenone has weak beta-blocking activity. Clinical trials employing isoproterenol challenge and exercise testing suggest that the affinity of propafenone for beta-adrenergic receptors, as calculated from dose ratios and drug concentrations, is about 1/40 that of propranolol. Propafenone also inhibits the slow calcium influx at high concentrations, however, this action is weak (approximately 1/100 of verapamil) and does not contribute to its antiarrhythmic effect. Electrophysiology Electrophysiology studies have shown that propafenone prolongs atrioventricular conduction and in some instances significantly lengthens sinus nodal recovery times with a non-significant effect on sinus cycle length. Both atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time (AH interval) and His- Purkinje conduction time (HV interval) are prolonged. Propafenone increases atrial, AV nodal and ventricular effective refractory periods. Propafenone causes a dose-dependent increase in the PR interval and QRS complex duration. Non-significant increases in the QTc interval and occasional slowing of the heart rate have also been observed. Hemodynamics - 3 - Propafenone can exert a negative inotropic effect on the myocardium. Increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, with a concurrent mild depression of cardiac output and cardiac index, have occurred following propafenone hydrochloride administration. Decreases in left ventricular function have been recorded in patients with depressed baseline function. Pharmacokinetics Due to a genetically determined presence or deficiency of one metabolizing pathway (CYP2D6), patients may be categorized into fast (over 90% of all patients) or slow metabolizers of propafenone, resulting in low or high plasma concentrations respectively. Following oral administration in fast metabolizers, propafenone hydrochloride is nearly completely absorbed and undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism resulting in a dose-dependent absolute bioavailability ranging from 3 to 40%. Peak plasma concentrations occur within 3 hours. For fast metabolizers of propafenone, the elimination t½ is 5.5 ± 2.1 hours; for slow metabolizers, the elimination t½ is 17.2 ± 8.0 hours. In fast metabolizers, there is a non-linear increase in drug plasma concentration and bioavailability with increase in dosage, presumably due to saturation of first pass hepatic metabolism. This departure from dose linearity occurs when single doses above 150 mg are given. A 300 mg dose gives plasma levels six times that of a 150 mg dose. Similarly, for a 3-fold increase in daily dose from 300 to 900 mg/day there is a 10-fold increase in steady-state plasma concentration. In slow metabolizers, as opposed to fast metabolizers, a linear relationship between propafenone hydrochloride dose and plasma concentration was observed. In fast metabolizers, propafenone hydrochloride undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism with <1% excreted as unchanged drug. The major active metabolites are: 5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OHP) which is formed by CYP2D6 and N-depropylpropafenone (NDPP) which is formed by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2; both metabolites occurring in concentrations less than 20% of the parent compound. In vitro preparations and animal studies have shown that the 5-OHP metabolite possesses antiarrhythmic and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity comparable to propafenone hydrochloride. Slow metabolizers had higher propafenone plasma concentrations which they required for suppression of arrhythmia since they did not produce the active metabolite 5-OHP. These higher propafenone plasma concentrations may lead to clinically evident beta-blockade. Despite these differences in pharmacokinetics, steady-state conditions are achieved after 3 to 4 days in all patients. Therapeutic plasma levels of propafenone appear to be in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 µg/mL. Propafenone is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Bioavailability is enhanced by administration of the drug with food. - 4 - INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE No antiarrhythmic drug has been shown to reduce the incidence of sudden death in patients with asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. Most antiarrhythmic drugs have the potential to cause dangerous arrhythmias; some have been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of sudden death. In light of the above, physicians should carefully consider the risks and benefits of antiarrhythmic therapy for all patients with ventricular arrhythmias. RYTHMOL® (propafenone hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of documented life- threatening ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia. Propafenone hydrochloride may also be used for the treatment of patients with documented symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias when the symptoms are of sufficient severity to require treatment. Because of the proarrhythmic effects of propafenone hydrochloride, its use should be reserved for patients in whom, in the opinion of the physician, the benefit of treatment clearly outweighs the risks. For patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia, propafenone hydrochloride therapy should be initiated in the hospital. Initiation in hospital may also be required for certain other patients depending on their cardiac status and underlying cardiac disease. The effects of propafenone hydrochloride in patients with recent myocardial infarction have not been adequately studied and, therefore, its use in this condition cannot be recommended. There is no evidence from controlled clinical trials that the use of propafenone hydrochloride favourably affects survival or the incidence of sudden death. RYTHMOL® (propafenone hydrochloride) is contraindicated in the presence of the following: CONTRAINDICATIONS • • • severe or uncontrolled congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS) cardiogenic shock sinoatrial, atrioventricular and intraventricular disorders of impulse conduction and sinus node dysfunction (e.g. sick sinus syndrome) in the absence of an artificial pacemaker severe bradycardia (less than 50 beats/min) • • marked hypotension • • • • bronchospastic disorders severe disorders of electrolyte balance severe hepatic failure (see PRECAUTIONS) known hypersensitivity to the drug - 5 - WARNINGS Mortality The results of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trials (CAST) in post-myocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias showed a significant increase in mortality and in the non-fatal cardiac arrest rate in patients treated with flecainide or encainide compared with a matched placebo-treated group. CAST was continued using a revised protocol with the moricizine and placebo arms only. The trial was prematurely terminated because of a trend towards an increase in mortality in the moricizine treated group. The applicability of these results to other populations or other antiarrhythmic agents is uncertain, but at present it is prudent to consider these results when using any antiarrhythmic agent in patients with structural heart disease. Proarrhythmic Effects RYTHMOL® (propafenone hydrochloride) may cause new or worsen existing arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects range from an increase in frequency of PVCs to the development of more severe ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes. It is therefore essential that each patient administered propafenone hydrochloride be evaluated clinically and electrocardiographically prior to, and during therapy to determine whether the response to propafenone supports continued treatment. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride, 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs, 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study (see above) suggests that a risk is present throughout treatment. Congestive Heart Failure During treatment with oral propafenone hydrochloride in patients with depressed baseline function (mean EF=33.5%), no significant decreases in ejection fraction were seen. In clinical trial experience, new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in 3.7% of patients; of those 0.9% were considered probably or definitely related to propafenone hydrochloride. Of the patients with CHF probably related to propafenone hydrochloride, 80% had preexisting heart failure and 85% had coronary artery disease. CHF attributable to propafenone hydrochloride developed rarely (<0.2%) in patients who had no previous history of CHF. Propafenone exerts both beta blockade and a dose related direct negative inotropic effect on myocardium. Therefore, propafenone hydrochloride should not be prescribed in patients with uncontrolled congestive heart failure where left ventricular output is less than 35%. Caution should be exercised when using propafenone hydrochloride in patients with minimal cardiac reserve or in those who are receiving other drugs with negative inotropic potential. - 6 - Effects on Cardiac Conduction Propafenone slows cardiac conduction which may result in a dose-related prolongation of PR interval and QRS complex, development of first or higher degree AV block, bundle branch block and intraventricular conduction delay (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Therefore, development of signs of increasing depression of cardiac conductivity during propafenone hydrochloride therapy requires a reduction in dosage or a discontinuation of propafenone hydrochloride unless the ventricular rate is adequately controlled by a pacemaker. Hematologic Disturbances Agranulocytosis has been reported infrequently in patients taking propafenone hydrochloride. The onset is generally within 4 to 6 weeks and presenting symptoms have included fever, fatigue, and malaise. Agranulocytosis occurs in less than 0.1% of patients taking propafenone hydrochloride. Patients should be instructed to immediately report fever, fatigue, malaise or any signs of infection, especially in the first three months of therapy. Prompt discontinuation of propafenone hydrochloride therapy is recommended when a decreased white blood cell count or other signs and symptoms warrant consideration of agranulocytosis/granulocytopenia. Cessation of propafenone hydrochloride therapy is usually followed by recovery of blood counts within two weeks. Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g. chronic bronchitis, emphysema) Patients with bronchospastic disease should, in general, not receive propafenone hydrochloride or other agents with beta-adrenergic blocking activity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Effects on Pacemaker Threshold PRECAUTIONS Patients with permanent pacemakers should have their existing thresholds re-evaluated after initiation of or change in RYTHMOL® (propafenone hydrochloride) therapy because of a possible increase in endocardial stimulation threshold. Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Since propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver it should be administered cautiously to patients with impaired hepatic function (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Administration of propafenone hydrochloride to these patients results in an increase in bioavailability to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% for patients with normal liver function, prolongation of the half life, a decrease in the systemic clearance, and a reduction in the serum protein binding of the drug. As a result, the dose of propafenone hydrochloride given to patients with impaired hepatic function should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). It is important to monitor electrocardiographic intervals for signs of excessive pharmacological effects (see SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE) and/or adverse reactions, until an individualized dosage regimen has been determined. Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function - 7 - To date there is no experience with use of oral propafenone hydrochloride in patients with impaired renal function. Since a considerable percentage of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine (18.5 to 38% of the dose/48 hrs), propafenone hydrochloride should be used cautiously in patients with renal impairment and only after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. These patients should be carefully monitored for signs of toxicity (see SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE). The dose in these patients has not been determined. Neuromuscular Dysfunction Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone hydrochloride therapy. Elevated ANA Titres In long term studies positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) titres have been reported in 21% of patients receiving propafenone hydrochloride. However, it is impossible to determine what exact percentage of patients had a new positive ANA titre as a result of propafenone hydrochloride therapy. This laboratory finding has not been associated with clinical symptoms. One case of Lupus-like syndrome has been reported which resolved upon discontinuation of therapy. Laboratory evaluation for antinuclear antibodies should be performed initially and at regular intervals. It is recommended that patients in whom an abnormal ANA test has occurred be evaluated regularly. If worsening elevation of ANA titres or clinical symptoms are detected, propafenone hydrochloride should be discontinued. Impaired Spermatogenesis Clinical evaluation of spermatogenesis was undertaken in 11 normal subjects, given oral propafenone hydrochloride 300 mg b.i.d. for 4 days which was then increased to 300 mg t.i.d. for an additional 4 days. Patients were followed for 128 days post-treatment and demonstrated a 28% reduction in semen sample volume following the last dose (day 8) and a 27% reduction in sperm count, on day 72. FSH and testosterone levels were also slightly decreased. Neither the decrease in sperm count nor the decrease in sample volume were sustained beyond the single visit in which they occurred, and both values remained within the laboratories normal reference range. Reduced spermatogenesis was also observed in animal experiments. The significance of these findings is uncertain. Use in the Elderly A slight increase in the incidence of dizziness was observed in elderly patients. Because of the possible increased risk of impaired hepatic or renal function in this age group, propafenone hydrochloride should be used with caution. The effective dose may be lower in these patients. Use in Children - 8 - The use of propafenone hydrochloride in children is not recommended, since safety and efficacy have not been established. Use in Pregnancy Propafenone has been shown to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in doses of 600 mg/kg (about 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis) and in the rabbit when given in doses of 150 mg/kg (about 3 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis). In a perinatal and postnatal study in rats, propafenone produced dose-dependent increases in maternal and neonatal mortality, decreased maternal and pup body weight gain and reduced neonatal physiological development. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Propafenone hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only when the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Propafenone is known to pass the placental barrier in humans. The concentration of propafenone in the umbilical cord has been reported to be about 30% of that in the maternal blood. Labour and Delivery It is not known whether the use of propafenone hydrochloride during labour or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, or whether it prolongs the duration of labour or increases the need for forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention. Nursing Mothers Propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone are excreted in human milk. Because of possible serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, an alternative method of infant feeding should be considered when the use of propafenone hydrochloride is considered essential. Drug Interactions Limited experience with propafenone hydrochloride combined with calcium antagonists and diuretics has been reported without evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, e.g., ketoconazole, cimetidine and quinidine, might lead to increased plasma levels of propafenone. When propafenone hydrochloride is administered with inhibitors of these enzymes, the patients should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly. Digitalis: Propafenone has been shown to produce dose-related increases in serum digoxin levels ranging from approximately 35% at 450 mg/day to 85% at 900 mg/day of propafenone without affecting digoxin renal clearance. Elevations of digoxin levels were maintained for up to 16 months during concomitant administration. Plasma digoxin levels of patients on concomitant therapy should be measured, and digoxin dosage should ordinarily be reduced when propafenone hydrochloride is started, especially if a relatively large digoxin dose is used or if plasma concentrations are relatively high. $-Antagonists: Warfarin: Cimetidine: Local anesthetics: Desipramine: - 9 - In a study involving healthy subjects, concomitant administration of propafenone hydrochloride and propranolol resulted in substantial increases in propranolol plasma concentration and elimination t½ with no change in propafenone plasma levels from control values. Similar observations have been reported with metoprolol. Propafenone appears to inhibit the hydroxylation pathway for the two beta-antagonists (just as quinidine inhibits propafenone metabolism). Increased plasma concentrations of metoprolol could overcome its relative cardioselectivity. In propafenone hydrochloride clinical trials, patients who were receiving beta- blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. While the therapeutic range for beta-blockers is wide, a reduction in dosage may be necessary during concomitant administration with propafenone hydrochloride. In a study of eight healthy subjects receiving propafenone hydrochloride and concomitant warfarin, mean steady-state warfarin plasma concentrations increased 39% with a corresponding prolongation in prothrombin times of approximately 25%. It is therefore recommended that in patients treated with propafenone hydrochloride and warfarin concomitantly, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored, and the dose of warfarin adjusted as necessary. Concomitant administration of propafenone hydrochloride tablets and cimetidine resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone with no detectable changes in electrocardiographic parameters beyond that measured on propafenone hydrochloride alone. Therefore, patients should be carefully monitored and the dose of propafenone hydrochloride adjusted when appropriate. Concomitant use of local anesthetics and propafenone hydrochloride may increase the risk of central nervous system side effects. Concomitant administration of propafenone hydrochloride and desipramine may result in elevated serum desipramine levels. Both desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, and propafenone are cleared by oxidative pathways of demethylation and hydroxylation carried out by the hepatic P-450 cytochrome. Cyclosporin: Propafenone hydrochloride therapy may increase levels of cyclosporin. Theophylline: Propafenone hydrochloride may increase theophylline concentration during concomitant therapy with the development of theophylline toxicity. Rifampin: Rifampin may accelerate the metabolism and decrease the plasma levels and antiarrhythmic efficacy of propafenone. - 10 - ADVERSE EVENTS In 2127 patients treated with RYTHMOL® (propafenone hydrochloride) in North American controlled and open clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions reported were dizziness (12.5%), nausea and/or vomiting (10.7%), unusual taste (8.8%) and constipation (7.2%). The adverse effects judged to be most severe were aggravation or induction of arrhythmia (4.7%), congestive heart failure (3.7%) and ventricular tachycardia (3.4%). The incidences for these three adverse reactions in patients with a previous history of myocardial infarction (MI) were 6.9%, 5.3% and 5.5%, while in patients without a history of MI the incidences were 3.0%, 2.4% and 1.8%, respectively. Approximately 20% of patients had propafenone hydrochloride discontinued due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions were dose related and occurred most frequently during the first month of therapy.

Causality and relationship to propafenone hydrochloride therapy cannot necessarily be judged from these events. Cardiovascular System: Atrial flutter, AV dissociation, cardiac arrest, flushing, hot flashes, sick sinus syndrome, sinus pause or arrest, supraventricular tachycardia, Torsades de Pointes, ventricular fibrillation. Gastrointestinal System: - 12 - A number of patients with liver abnormalities associated with propafenone hydrochloride therapy have been reported in foreign post-marketing experience. Some appeared due to hepatocellular injury, some were cholestatic and some showed a mixed picture. Some of these reports were simply discovered through clinical chemistries, others because of clinical symptoms. One case was rechallenged with a positive outcome. Cholestasis (0.1%), elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases) (0.2%), gastroenteritis, hepatitis (0.03%). General Disorders: Chest pain. Hematologic: Agranulocytosis (see WARNINGS), anemia, bruising, granulocytopenia, increased bleeding time, leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Immune System: Allergic reactions.

Alopecia, eye irritation, hyponatremia/inappropriate ADH secretion, impotence, increased glucose, kidney failure, positive ANA (0.7%), Lupus erythematosis, muscle cramps, muscle weakness, nephrotic syndrome, pain, pruritus. SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE The symptoms of overdose may include hypotension, somnolence, convulsions, bradycardia, conduction disturbances, ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation. If ingestion is recent perform gastric lavage or induce emesis. Supportive measures such as mechanical respiratory assistance and cardiac massage may be necessary. Defibrillation and the use of a temporary pacemaker, as well as infusion of isoproterenol and dopamine have been effective in controlling cardiac rhythm and blood pressure. Convulsions have been alleviated with intravenous diazepam. Detoxification measures such as forced diuresis, hemoperfusion and hemodialysis have not proven useful. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION - 13 - The dose of RYTHMOL® (propafenone hydrochloride) must be individually determined on the basis of patient's response and tolerance. The usefulness of monitoring plasma levels for optimization of therapy has not been established. The recommended dose titration regimen can be used for both fast and slow metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The initial dose of propafenone hydrochloride is 150 mg given every 8 hours (450 mg/day). Dosage may be increased at 3 to 4 day intervals to 300 mg every 12 hours (600 mg/day). Should a further increase in dosage be necessary a maximum dose of 300 mg every 8 hours (900 mg/day) may be given. In those patients in whom widening of the QRS complex (>0.12 sec) or prolongation of PR interval (>0.24 sec) occurs, the dosage of propafenone hydrochloride should be reduced. Administration of propafenone hydrochloride with food is recommended. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS) propafenone hydrochloride therapy should be initiated with 150 mg given once (150 mg/day) daily. The dosage may be increased at a minimum of 4 day intervals to 150 mg twice (300 mg/day) daily then to 150 mg every 8 hours (450 mg/day) and, if necessary, to 300 mg every 12 hours (600 mg/day). There is no information on dosing with propafenone hydrochloride in patients with renal impairment. Propafenone hydrochloride should be used cautiously in these patients and only after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. These patients should be carefully monitored for signs of toxicity. Lower doses may be required (see PRECAUTIONS). In elderly patients the effective dose of propafenone hydrochloride may be lower (see PRECAUTIONS). There is no information on the appropriate regimen for the transfer from lidocaine to propafenone hydrochloride. - 14 - Trade name: PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION RYTHMOL® Proper name: Propafenone hydrochloride Chemical name: Structural formula: 2'-(2-hydroxy-3-propylaminopropoxy)-3-phenylpropriophenone hydrochloride Molecular weight: 377.92 Molecular formula: - C21H27N03!HCl Description: Propafenone hydrochloride occurs as colourless crystals or white crystalline powder with a very bitter taste.

Electrically-induced ventricular fibrillation was controlled by propafenone (2 mg/kg i.v.) in the guinea pig and rabbit. Chloroform- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias were reduced or abolished by propafenone in the cat (1 mg/kg i.v., 2 to 10 mg/kg i.v.) and dog (1 mg/kg i.v., 10 mg/kg oral) as were arrhythmias induced by calcium chloride, glycoside and coronary ligature in the dog (1 to 4 mg/kg i.v.). Aconitine-induced arrhythmias were also controlled by propafenone in the rabbit (3 mg/kg i.v.). Propafenone can be classified as an antiarrhythmic drug with a membrane stabilizing effect. Hemodynamics In the dog, the force of ventricular contraction and blood pressure were not affected by doses of 3 mg/kg i.v.. However, after higher doses of 12 mg/kg i.v. or in hearts predamaged by coronary ligature, or when administering beta-blockers concomitantly, a fall in blood pressure, a reduction in the heart rate and contractility, and an increase in ECG-intervals (PR and QRS) have been seen. Other Structural similarities between propafenone and propranolol prompted several animal investigations into the possible beta-blocking effects of propafenone. A beta1-sympatholytic action on isolated heart preparations (guinea pigs) and a beta2-sympatholytic action on the coronary arteries and tracheal muscles (bovine) have been demonstrated in vitro. In vivo studies in rats showed that the antiarrhythmic effect occurred with i.v. doses seven times lower than necessary for the beta- blocking effect (ED50 at 0.437 mg/kg and 3.25 mg/kg respectively). However, the in vitro beta- blocking effect of propafenone occurred in the same dose range as the antiarrhythmic effect. In in vitro studies of bovine coronary arteries, propafenone (56.0 mg/L) yielded a relaxing effect weaker than that of etafenone, papaverine, hexobendine, fendiline and oxifedrine but stronger than that of theophylline, aminophylline and carbocromen. In bovine tracheal muscle, and guinea pig colon, the potency of propafenone was the same as that of papaverine. In vivo, canine duodenum tone decreased slightly after i.v. propafenone, 0.5 to 4.0 mg/kg, with a marked decrease of the amplitude of peristalsis following propafenone, 1.0 to 4.0 mg/kg. The local anesthetic activity of propafenone was demonstrated in the cornea of conscious guinea pigs with a 0.5% solution of propafenone. - 17 - TOXICOLOGY Acute Toxicology LD50 Values Observed in the Acute Toxicity Studies Table 2 Species Mouse Route oral Rat (Adult) Rat (Juvenile) i.v. oral i.v. oral i.v.

High dose group had significantly increased heart weights, with focal muscle cell degeneration. Reduced spermatogenesis was found on histological examination in all groups. Changes were observed in the 3.5 mg/kg group. Sedation, tremor and reduced alertness were noted as well as reduction in body weight gain and food and water consumption. Clinical laboratory tests revealed decreases in erythrocyte count and serum urea, sodium and phosphorus values. Increases in serum chloride were also noted. A decrease in serum sodium values was observed in rats receiving 300 mg/kg. Due to high mortality, the intermediate and high doses were reduced after eight weeks. Death was preceded by weight loss or reduced weight gain. Intermediate doses produced sedation and reduced reflexes. Sedation, apathy, ataxia, impaired coordination, shaggy skin, loose stool and intermittent tonic-clonic convulsions occurred in the high dose group. Histopathology revealed a dose related increase in fatty liver cells and kidney protein cylinders in the tubuli. Nephritis was observed in the high dose group. Focal to complete degeneration of the tubular epithelial cells in the testes was observed equally in all dose groups. Due to high mortality, the high dose was decreased after 6 weeks. Primarily in the high dose group, observations included unkempt coat, sedation, ataxia and apathy. Inhibition of body weight gain occurred in all groups. Inflammatory renal lesions (nephritis and nephrohydrosis) caused by precipitations of propafenone in the upper tubules was noted in several high dose and one intermediate dose animal. - 19 - Summary of Subacute and Chronic Toxicity Studies Table 3 Daily Dose (mg/kg) No. of Animals Per Dose Group No. of Deaths Per Dose Group Toxic Effects Species Route of Dosing Duration of Dosing Dog (Beagle) i.v. 4 weeks Dog (Beagle) Dog (Mongrel) Dog (Beagle) Dog (Beagle) Monkey (Rhesus) i.v. 4 weeks oral 4 weeks oral 6 months oral 52 weeks i.v. 4 weeks 0 0.3 1.0 5.0 0 1.0 2.2 5.0 0 20 50 100 0 30 120 240 (180) (210) (240) 0 30 60 120 0 2.0 5.0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6 6 6 10 10 10 10 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 The 5 mg/kg animals showed a reduction in bodyweight and food consumption, and increased restlessness, timidity, anxiety and shaggy coats. Tremor, reduced responses and spontaneous defecation were observed immediately post injection. ECG tracings taken at the end of the stay revealed significant heart rate reduction. Laboratory evaluations revealed significantly lowered LDH, BUN, Na, CI, and inorganic phosphorus. Complete cessation of spermatogenesis was observed on histopathology. The 5 mg/kg group showed a decrease in serum potassium. Reduction in bodyweight and increased heart and liver weights were observed in the high dose group. The following effects were observed in the 120 mg/kg group: sedation, intermittent tremor, reduced body weight gain and food consumption. Prothrombin time was also shortened. Due to one death and the marked deterioration of remaining animals in the 240 mg/kg group, the dose was reduced to 180 mg/kg at 9 weeks and gradually increased to 240 mg/kg at the thirtieth week. At this dose, animals exhibited apathy, sedation, ataxia, convulsions, vomiting, salivation, diarrhea, reduced body weight gain and food intake, reduced prothrombin time, decreased LDH values and increased uric acid. Vomiting was observed in the 60 mg/kg dosed dogs. The 120 mg/kg dogs exhibited vomiting, ataxia and tremor with tonic-clonic spasm. Biochemical analysis showed decreased total protein and globulins. One animal at 60 mg/kg and 3 animals at 120 mg/kg died. Probable cause of death: circulatory collapse. A dose related decrease in body weight gain was reported. All animals treated showed a decrease in the ejaculation volume and sperm count. Death of all spermatozoa was observed in the high dose group. The following was observed on histopathology: inhibition of spermatogenesis in the 2.0 mg/kg group and more severe disorders of spermatogenesis (including absence of spermatozoa maturation, severe degree of atypical nuclei with hyperchromasia and an increased number of nucleus pycnosis) in the 5.0 mg/kg dose group. Sperm counts returned to normal within 8 weeks post study. Reproduction and Teratology Studies - 20 - Fertility and General Reproductive Performance: SPF albino rats (24/sex/dose) received 0, 30, 90, 270 mg/kg/day of propafenone hydrochloride p.o. (gavage). Males were treated for 70 days prior to mating and females began treatment 14 days prior to mating. Both continued treatment for a maximum of 14 days during the mating period. Propafenone hydrochloride did not produce any adverse effects on fertility but increased the time required for mating. Male Wistar rats (20/group) and male albino rabbits (10/group) received oral propafenone hydrochloride at doses of 0 or 150 mg/kg (rats) and 0 or 120 mg/kg (rabbits) over 10 weeks (6 days/week). On the last day of treatment in the rat and after termination of treatment in the rabbit, each male was paired with 2 non-treated females. There was no effect in either species on fertility, mating behaviour, or litter size. Teratology Studies: Female Wistar rats (20/group) received oral propafenone hydrochloride (gavage) at doses of 0, 90, 270 or 600 mg/kg from the 5th to the 15th day of pregnancy. There was no evidence of teratogenicity at any dose. An embryotoxic effect (i.e. increased resorption rates and decreased fetal weights), was detected at the highest dose level. This dose was already toxic to dams as evidenced by reduced weight gain. White pregnant female New Zealand rabbits received oral (gavage) propafenone hydrochloride at doses of 0, 15, 30 or 150 mg/kg/day from the 6th to the 18th day of pregnancy. Fetuses of the intermediate and high dose group showed variations (retarded ossification of the skull, the coccygeal vertebra and end-phalanx). The number of resorption and dead fetuses was increased in the high dose group. This dose was toxic to the dam as evidenced by reduced weight gain and increased mortality. Spermatogenesis Intravenous administration of propafenone hydrochloride in doses of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg for 3 weeks to NZ-rabbits (2/dose) resulted in reduced spermatogenesis. The dose of 1.0 mg/kg produced degenerated spermatogenic epithelium in the testes of all animals. Additional studies of spermatogenesis were performed in the monkey, dog and rabbit. After i.v. administration of 2 and 5 mg/kg propafenone hydrochloride per day to monkeys for 4 weeks, decreased spermatogenesis occurred, but was reversible 8 weeks after discontinuation of propafenone hydrochloride. Minor alterations in the spermatogram (oligospermia) were observed in dogs administered 5 mg/kg i.v. for 4 weeks and rabbits administered 3.5 and 5 mg/kg i.v. for 6 days. The phenomenon was reversible 4 weeks after discontinuation of propafenone hydrochloride. No injury to the parenchyma of the testes occurred, nor did electron microscopy demonstrate any changes in the spermatogenic epithelium of rabbits. Mutagenicity Study The mutagenic potential of propafenone was investigated in bacteria in vitro (Salmonella/ microsome assay) as well as in Chinese hamsters, rats and mice in vivo. No indication of mutagenic activity was detected in any of these studies. Carcinogenicity Studies - 21 - Propafenone hydrochloride was administered in doses of 60, 180 and 540 (360) mg/kg to NMR mice for 104 weeks. After 21 weeks, the maximum dose was reduced to 360 mg/kg for the remainder of the study. Sprague-Dawley rats were given doses of 30, 90 and 270 mg/kg in the food for 30 months. In these studies propafenone hydrochloride was not carcinogenic. - 22 - REFERENCES 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. Baker BJ, Dinh H, Kroskey D, de Soyza N, Murphy ML, Franciosa JA.

Date of Preparation: July 15, 2003 Control Number: 074948 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Product Monograph PrAVODART™ dutasteride capsules Type I and II 5 Alpha-reductase Inhibitor Actions and Clinical Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Dutasteride, a synthetic 4-azasteriod compound, inhibits the conversion of testosterone to 5 \"-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 \"-reductase, which exists as 2 isoforms, Type I and Type II. The Type II isoenzyme is primarily active in the reproductive tissues while the Type I isoenzyme is also responsible for testosterone conversion in the skin and liver. Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both Type I and Type II 5 \"-reductase isoenzymes, with which it forms a stable enzyme complex. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow. Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor. The maximum effect of daily doses of dutasteride on the reduction on DHT is dose dependent and is observed within 1-2 weeks. After 1 week and 2 weeks of daily dosing of dutasteride 0.5mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90% respectively. DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 2 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. In patients with BPH treated with dutasteride 0.5mg/day, the median decrease in serum DHT was 94% at 1 year and 93% at 2 years and the median increase in serum testosterone was 19% at both 1 and 2 years. The testosterone concentrations remain within the physiological normal range. Pharmacokinetics Dutasteride is rapidly absorbed with peak concentrations occurring at 1 to 3 hours and absorption is not affected by food. Absolute bioavailability is approximate 60% relative to a 2-hour intravenous infusion. Dutasteride has a large volume of distribution (300-500L) and is highly bound to proteins in plasma (>99.5%). The half-life of dutasteride is 3 to 5 weeks. Steady state serum concentrations (Css) of approximately 40ng/mL are achieved after 6 months of dosing with dutasteride 0.5mg once daily. Similarly, dutasteride concentrations in semen reached steady-state at 6 months. After 52 weeks of treatment, semen dutasteride concentrations averaged 3.4ng/mL (range 0.4 to 14ng/mL). Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in humans. Studies showed that CYP3A4 isoenzymes are involved in metabolism of dutasteride. Dutasteride and its metabolites were excreted mainly in feces. Only trace amounts of unchanged dutasteride were found in urine (<1%) (see PHARMACOLOGY, Human). DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 3 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Special Populations Elderly Dutasteride pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were evaluated in 36 healthy male subjects between the ages of 24 and 87 years following administration of a single 5mg dose of dutasteride. Exposure of dutasteride, represented by AUC and Cmax values, was not statistically different when comparing age groups. Half-life was not statistically different when comparing the 50-69 year old group to the greater than 70 years old group which encompasses the age of most men with BPH. No differences in drug effect as measured by DHT reduction were observed between age groups. Results indicated that no dutasteride dose adjustment based on age is necessary. Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied. However, less than 0.1% of a steady-state 0.5mg dose of dutasteride is recovered in human urine, so no adjustment in dosage is anticipated for patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment The effect on the pharmacokinetics of dutasteride in hepatic impairment has not been studied. Clinical Studies AVODART™ (dutasteride) soft gelatin capsules 0.5 mg/day (n = 2167) or placebo (n = 2158) were evaluated in male subjects with BPH in three pivotal 2-year multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, each with 2-year open-label extensions. More than 90% of the study population was Caucasian. DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 4 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Subjects were at least 50 years of age with BPH diagnosed by medical history and physical examination, including enlarged prostate ($30 cc) and BPH symptoms that were moderate to severe according to the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI). Most of the 4,325 subjects randomly assigned to receive either dutasteride or placebo completed the first 2 years of treatment (70% and 67%, respectively). Data from these studies demonstrate that treatment with AVODART™ (0.5mg once daily) reduces the risk of both AUR and BPH-related surgical intervention relative to placebo, improves BPH-related symptoms, decreases prostate volume, and increases maximum urinary flow rates. A 12 month randomized, double blind, double dummy, parallel group study of AVODART™ (dutasteride) 0.5mg once daily versus finasteride 5mg once daily was conducted. Patients included in the study were 50 years or older with a diagnosis of moderately severe or severely symptomatic BPH with a prostate volume $30cc. A total of 813 patients received AVODART™ and 817 patients received finasteride 5mg. In the study, AVODART™ was observed to have a similar efficacy, tolerability and adverse event profile to finasteride 5mg. DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 5 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Indications and Clinical Use AVODART™ (dutasteride) soft gelatin capsules are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) in men with enlarged prostates. AVODART™ has been shown to: • • • reduce prostate size, improve urinary flow and symptoms of BPH reduce the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) reduce the need for BPH related surgery. Contraindications AVODART™ (dutasteride) soft gelatin capsules are contraindicated for use in women and children (see WARNINGS, Exposure of Women-Risk to Male Fetus). AVODART™ is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to dutasteride, other 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, or any component of the preparation. Warnings Exposure of Women-Risk to Male Fetus: AVODART™ (dutasteride) soft gelatin capsules should not be handled by women who are pregnant or may be pregnant since dutasteride is absorbed through the skin. Because of the ability of Type I and II 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors such as dutasteride to inhibit conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, AVODART™ may cause abnormalities of the external genital organs in a male fetus carried by a woman exposed to dutasteride (see DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 6 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. CONTRAINDICATIONS). It is not known whether dutasteride is excreted in human milk. General Precautions Prior to treatment with AVODART™, patients should be assessed thoroughly to rule out other urological diseases including prostate cancer. Patients with a large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow may not be proper candidates for 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy and should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. No study has been conducted to determine if AVODART™ can be used for the control of BPH in asymptomatic patients. The long-term (>2 years) beneficial and adverse effects of AVODART™ have not been established. Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and Prostate Cancer Detection Digital rectal examination, as well as other evaluations for prostate cancer, should be performed on patients with BPH prior to initiating therapy with AVODART™ (dutasteride) soft gelatin capsules and periodically thereafter. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration is an important component of the screening process to detect prostate cancer. Generally, a total serum PSA concentration greater than 4ng/mL (Hybritech) requires further evaluation and consideration of prostate biopsy. Physicians should be aware that a baseline DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 7 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. PSA less than 4ng/mL in patients taking AVODART™ does not exclude a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Dutasteride causes a decrease in serum PSA levels by approximately 50%, after 6 months, in patients with BPH, even in the presence of prostate cancer. Although there may be individual variation, the reduction in PSA by approximately 50% is predictable as it was observed over the entire range of baseline PSA values (1.5 to 10ng/mL). Therefore, to interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with AVODART™ for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. This adjustment preserves the sensitivity and specificity of the PSA assay and maintains its ability to detect prostate cancer. Any sustained increases in PSA levels while on AVODART™ should be carefully evaluated, including consideration of noncompliance to therapy with AVODART™. Total serum PSA levels return to baseline within 6 months of discontinuing treatment. The ratio of free to total PSA remains constant even under the influence of AVODART™. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing AVODART™ therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. Blood Donation Men treated with dutasteride should not donate blood until at least 6 months have passed following their last dose. The purpose of this deferred period is to prevent administration of dutasteride to a pregnant female transfusion recipient. Use in the Elderly Dutasteride pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were evaluated in 36 healthy male subjects between the ages of 24 and 87 years following DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 8 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. administration of a single 5mg dose of dutasteride. Results indicated that no dutasteride dose adjustment based on age is necessary. Use in Children BPH is not a disease of childhood. AVODART™ is not indicated for use in children. Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Use in Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Because dutasteride is extensively metabolized and has a half-life of 3 to 5 weeks, caution should be used in the administration of dutasteride to patients with liver disease. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether dutasteride is excreted in human milk. Hormone Levels Effect of daily doses of AVODART™ on the reduction on DHT is dose dependant and is observed within 1-2 weeks (85% and 90% reduction, respectively). In patients with BPH treated with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day, the median decrease in serum DHT was 94% at 1 year and 93% at 2 years and the median increase in serum testosterone was 19% at both 1 and 2 years. Drug Interaction Dutasteride is metabolised by human cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. Although no drug interactions of clinical importance have been identified, caution should be taken when administering dutasteride to patients taking potent, chronic DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 9 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. CYP3A4 isoenzyme inhibitors. Clinical drug interaction studies have shown no clinically significant interactions between dutasteride and tamsulosin, terazosin, warfarin, digoxin, and cholestyramine. Although specific interaction studies were not performed with other compounds, approximately 90% of the subjects in the three phase III pivotal efficacy studies receiving dutasteride were taking other medications concomitantly. No clinically significant adverse interactions could be attributed to the combination of AVODART™ and concurrent therapy when AVODART™ was co-administered with anti-hyperlipidemics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), phosphodiesterase Type V inhibitors, and quinolone antibiotics. Information to be Provided to the Patient Physicians should instruct their patients to read the Information for Consumer leaflet before starting therapy with AVODART™ soft gelatin capsules and to reread it upon prescription renewal for new information regarding the use of AVODART™. AVODART™ soft gelatin capsules should not be handled by a woman who is pregnant or who may become pregnant because of the potential for absorption of dutasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a developing male fetus (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin, therefore women and children must avoid contact with leaking capsules. If contact is made with leaking capsules, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water (see DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 10 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). Men treated with dutasteride should not donate blood until at least 6 months have passed following their last dose to prevent pregnant women from receiving dutasteride through blood transfusion (see PRECAUTIONS, Blood Donation). Some patients experienced impotence, decreased libido, gynaecomastia, and ejaculation disorders (which includes a decrease in ejaculate volume) during the clinical trial. These adverse events were considered by the investigators to be drug-related (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions were generally mild, transient, and related to the pharmacology of a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal in both treatment groups were associated with the reproductive system. The data described below reflect exposure to dutasteride in 2,167 male subjects, including 1,510 exposed for 2 years. Over 4,300 male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5mg daily doses of AVODART™ soft gelatin capsules in 3 identical, placebo-controlled Phase III treatment studies. The population was aged 47 to 94 years and about 90% Caucasian. Over the 2-year treatment period, 376 subjects (9% of each treatment group) were withdrawn from the studies due to adverse experiences, usually associated with the reproductive system. Withdrawals due to adverse events considered by the investigator to be potentially drug-related occurred in 4% of the subjects receiving AVODART™ and in 3% of the subjects receiving placebo. The following investigator-judged drug related adverse events (with incidence $1%) DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 11 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. have been reported in subjects receiving AVODART™ and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving placebo: Number (and percentage) of patients with investigator- Adverse Event Year 1 judged drug-related adverse events (incidence $1%) Year 2 Impotence Altered (decreased) libido Ejaculation disorders Gynecomastia* Placebo Dutasteride Placebo Dutasteride N = 2,158 65 (3.0%) 41 (1.9%) 15 (0.7%) 11 (0.5%) N = 2,167 130 (6.0%) 80 (3.7%) 40 (1.8%) 28 (1.3%) N = 1,736 21 (1.2%) 6 (0.3%) 2 (0.1%) 5 (0.3%) N = 1,744 29 (1.7%) 11 (0.6%) 9 (0.5%) 23 (1.3%) * Includes breast enlargement and/or breast tenderness Long-Term Treatment: The adverse events profile in patients treated with AVODART™ for 24 months was consistent with that observed after 12 month treatment. The incidence of drug-related events with onset during the second year of treatment was lower compared with the first year of treatment, with the exception of gynecomastia (onset in 1.3% during both first and second year). Symptoms and Treatment of Overdosage In volunteer studies of AVODART™ (dutasteride) soft gelatin capsules, single daily doses of dutasteride up to 40mg/day (80 times the therapeutic dose) have been administered for 7 days without significant safety concerns. In clinical studies, doses of 5mg daily have been administered to subjects for 6 months with no additional adverse effects to those seen at therapeutic doses of 0.5mg. There is no specific antidote for AVODART™. Therefore, in cases of suspected overdosage, symptomatic and supportive treatment should be given as DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 12 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. appropriate. Dosage and Administration Adult males (including elderly) The recommended dose of AVODART™ (dutasteride) soft gelatin capsules is, one 0.5mg capsule taken orally once a day. The capsules should be swallowed whole (see WARNINGS, Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus and Pharmaceutical Information, Safe Handling). AVODART™ may be taken with or without food. Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied. However, less than 0.1% of a steady state 0.5mg dose of dutasteride is recovered in human urine, and no adjustment in dose is anticipated for patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Because dutasteride is extensively metabolized and has a half-life of 3 to DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 13 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. 5 weeks, caution should be used in the administration of dutasteride to patients with liver disease.

Information for the Patient AVODART™ is for use by men only Please read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking AVODART™. Please read it each time you refill your prescription, just in case there may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of careful discussions with your doctor. You should discuss AVODART™ with your doctor when you start taking your medication and at regular checkups. Prior to treatment with AVODART™, you should have a thorough urological evaluation to determine the severity of your condition, and to exclude the need for immediate surgery or the possibility of prostate cancer. A thorough urological examination generally includes a digital rectal examination (DRE) and an evaluation of urinary symptoms. Your physician may also obtain a blood test for prostate specific antigen (PSA) (see About Prostate Specific Antigen). Full prescribing information of AVODART™ is available to the doctor and pharmacist. What is in your medicine AVODART™ soft gelatin capsules contain the active ingredient dutasteride. There are also some inactive ingredients in your medicine including butylated hydroxytoluene, gelatin, glycerol, iron oxide yellow, lecithin, medium chain triglycerides, monodiglycerides of caprylic/capric acid, purified water, titanium dioxide, and red printing ink containing iron oxide red as the colourant. What AVODART™ is and what it is used for AVODART™ belongs to a group of medicines called 5 alpha-reductase enzyme inhibitors which are used in men who have a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, which is located at the lower portion of the urinary bladder surrounding the urethra (urine carrying DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 17 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. tube). In men with BPH, the prostate gland becomes large enough to squeeze the urine tube running through it. If the urine tube is squeezed it narrows, making it more difficult with urination resulting in some or all of the following symptoms: • Difficulty in starting to urinate • An interrupted, weak urinary stream • More frequent urination, especially at night • Urgency and leaking or dribbling • A feeling that you cannot empty your bladder completely As the disease progresses, untreated BPH can lead to an increased risk of complete blockage of urine flow (acute urinary retention) and/or the need for surgery. Who should NOT take AVODART™? 1. Women and children should not take AVODART™. A woman who is pregnant or capable of becoming pregnant should not handle AVODART™ soft gelatin capsules. If a woman who is pregnant with a male baby gets enough AVODART™ into her body by swallowing it or through her skin after handling it, the male baby may be born with abnormal sex organs. In case of accidental swallowing or physical contact with AVODART™, a pregnant women should consult a doctor. The solution in the capsule may be absorbed through the skin. Therefore, anyone who handles punctured or leaking capsules should immediately wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water. 2. Do not take AVODART™ if you had an allergic reaction, for example skin hives or swollen lips, to AVODART™ or any of its ingredients (see WHAT IS AVODART™). 3. Tell your doctor if you have liver problem. AVODART™ may not be suitable for you. How is BPH treated? There are three main options for treating BPH. You and your doctor should decide DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 18 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. which option is best for you after considering the size of your prostate and how troublesome your symptoms are. • Watchful waiting: If you have an enlarged prostate but your BPH symptoms are not particularly bothersome, your doctor may recommend regular check-ups to monitor your symptoms and no other treatment at this time. • Medication: If your symptoms are too bothersome for you, your doctor may recommend treatment with a medicine to relax smooth muscle in the prostate and/or a medicine to decrease prostate size. Dutasteride works by shrinking your prostate size as described below under \"How does AVODART™ work?\" • Surgery: For some patients, BPH may be treated by surgery. Your doctor can describe the different surgical procedures for BPH. Your doctor will be able to evaluate whether this is the best treatment for you. How does AVODART™ work? Prostate growth is caused by a hormone in the blood called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Dutasteride lowers DHT production in the body, leading to shrinkage of the enlarged prostate in most men. Just as your prostate became large over a long period of time, reducing the size of your prostate and improving your symptoms may take time. While some men have fewer problems and symptoms after 3 months of treatment with AVODART™, a treatment period of at least 6 months is usually necessary to see if AVODART™ will work for you. Over time treatment with AVODART™ can lead to gradual improvement in urine flow and symptoms. AVODART™ may reduce the risk of developing complete blockage of urinary flow (acute urinary retention) and the need for surgery. What are the special precautions about AVODART™? Men treated with AVODART™ should not donate blood until at least 6 months after their final dose in order to prevent giving AVODART™ to a pregnant woman through blood transfusion. What are possible side effects of AVODART™? The most common side effects of AVODART™ are impotence (not able to achieve or maintain an erection), decrease in libido (decreased desire to have sex or a reduced sex drive), changes or problems with ejaculations (including a decrease in amount of semen released during sex) and breast swelling or tenderness. DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 19 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. If you notice these side effects and any other side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, tell your doctor or pharmacist. Interactions with other medicines Make sure your doctor knows what other medicines you are taking, or have recently taken. Remember to include all medicines, herbal remedies or dietary supplements, such as vitamins, iron or calcium, which you have bought yourself. Checking for prostate cancer Your doctor has prescribed AVODART™ for symptomatic BPH and not for cancer. But a man can have BPH and prostate cancer at the same time. Doctors usually recommend that men be checked for prostate cancer once a year when they turn 50 (or 40 if a family member has had prostate cancer). These checks should continue while you take AVODART™. About Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Your physician may have done a blood test called PSA. AVODART™ can alter PSA values. For more information, talk to your physician.

DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 21 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Human Pharmacokinetics Pharmacology Dutasteride is administered orally as a solution in soft gelatin capsules. Following oral administration of a single 0.5mg dutasteride soft capsule, the time to peak serum concentrations of dutasteride is 1 to 3 hours. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 60% relative to a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The bioavailability of dutasteride is not affected by food. Dutasteride has a large volume of distribution (300 to 500L) and is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99.5%). Following daily dosing, dutasteride serum concentrations achieve 65% of steady state concentration after 1 month and approximately 90% after 3 months. Steady state serum concentrations (Css) of approximately 40ng/mL are achieved after 6 months of dosing 0.5mg once a day. Similarly to serum, dutasteride concentrations in semen achieved steady state at 6 months. After 52 weeks of therapy, semen dutasteride concentrations averaged 3.4ng/mL (range 0.4 to 14ng/mL). Dutasteride partitioning from serum into semen averaged 11.5%. In vitro, dutasteride is metabolized by the human cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 to two minor monohydroxylated metabolites, but is not metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6. In human serum, following dosing to steady state, unchanged dutasteride, 3 major metabolites (4'-hydroxydutasteride, 1,2-dihydrodutasteride and 6-hydroxydutasteride) and 2 minor metabolites (6,4'-dihydroxydutasteride and 15-hydroxydutasteride), as assessed by mass spectrometric response, have been detected. The five human serum metabolites DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 22 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. of dutasteride have been detected in rat serum, however the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl additions at the 6 and 15 positions in the human and rat metabolites is not known. Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in vivo. Following oral dosing of dutasteride 0.5mg/day to steady state in humans, 1.0% to 15.4% (mean of 5.4%) of the administered dose is excreted as dutasteride in the faeces. The remainder is excreted in the faeces as 4 major metabolites comprising 39%, 21%, 7%, and 7% each of drug-related material and 6 minor metabolites (less than 5% each). Only trace amounts of unchanged dutasteride (less than 0.1% of the dose) are detected in human urine. At therapeutic concentrations, the terminal half-life of dutasteride is 3 to 5 weeks. Serum DHT concentrations which correlate to clinical effect, return to baseline (no clinical effect) within approximately 4 months after discontinuation of treatment. Dutasteride pharmacokinetics can be described as first order absorption process and two parallel elimination pathways, one saturable (concentration dependent) and one non-saturable (concentration independent). At low serum concentrations (less than 3ng/mL), dutasteride is cleared rapidly by both the concentration dependent and concentration independent elimination pathways. Single doses of 5mg or less showed evidence of rapid clearance and a short half-life of 3 to 9 days. At serum concentrations greater than 3ng/mL, dutasteride is cleared slowly by linear elimination with a half-life of 3 to 5 weeks. At therapeutic concentrations, following repeat dosing of 0.5mg/day, the slower clearance dominates and the total clearance is linear and concentration independent. Dose proportionality analysis across doses (0.5mg - 5.0mg) on Day 1 and Day 28 indicated that the pharmacokinetics of dutasteride were dose independent.

Clinical Studies AVODART™ soft gelatin capsules 0.5mg/day or placebo was evaluated in three primary efficacy 2-year multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies involving 4,325 male subjects with BPH who had prostates $30ccs and a PSA value within the range 1.5 - 10ng/mL . In men with BPH, AVODART™ treats and prevents the progression of BPH by reducing the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and the need for surgical intervention (SI) and by providing statistically significant improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), maximum urinary flow (Qmax) and prostate volume relative to placebo. AVODART™ was associated with an improvement in health status. The following figure (1) represents pooled phase III data for AUA-SI. *AU A SI (Am erican Urological Association Symptom Index) is a seven-item questionnaire with a maximum score of 35. Entry criteria included a screening score of $12 (moderate to severe symptoms). A reduction in score signifies an improvement in symptoms. DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 24 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Mean baseline values for AUA-SI were similar for dutasteride and placebo, 17 and 17.1 units respectively. Early improvements in AUA-SI (symptoms) were seen with dutasteride in some patients. Compared to placebo at Month 6, dutasteride was associated with a significantly greater change from baseline (p<0.001). Symptoms continued to improve through to Month 24. Qmax (maximum urine flow) Early improvements in Qmax were seen with AVODART™ in some patients. Compared to placebo, AVODART™ was associated with a significantly greater change from baseline at Month 1 in one study (p=0.006), and at Month 3 in all three studies.

At month 24, the mean increase in Qmax across the three studies pooled was 1.8 mL/sec for dutasteride and DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 25 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. 0.7mL/sec for placebo; the mean difference (dutasteride minus placebo) was 1.1 mL/sec (range, 1.0 to 1.2 mL/sec in each of the three studies, p<0.001). Acute Urinary Retention and Surgical Intervention Data at 24 months show that dutasteride significantly reduces the risk of both AUR (57%) and surgery (48%) relative to placebo (p<0.001). Prostate Volume Significant reductions in prostate volume have been detected as early as one month after initiation of treatment and reductions continued through Month 24 (p<0.001).

As the prostate volume is reduced, there is greater symptom improvement. Combination Study AVODART™ was used in combination with tamsulosin, an alpha1-adrenergic blocking agent, for up to 36 weeks in a multicentre double blind parallel group study involving 327 patients. After 24 weeks of combination therapy approximately 50% of patients had tamsulosin withdrawn. Seventy-seven percent of patients who continued with AVODART™ monotherapy felt the same or better 6 weeks after withdrawal of tamsulosin and 93% of these patients had sustained symptom control 12 weeks after withdrawal. Maintenance of symptom control was DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 27 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. proportionally slightly higher in patients who continued on combination therapy (91% Vs 77% at Week 30). Both regimens were well tolerated (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Toxicology Acute Toxicology In acute oral toxicity studies, the maximum non-lethal dose (MNLD) was >2,000 mg/kg in mice and >1,500 mg/kg in rats, which is 200,000 and 150,000 times greater, respectively, than the proposed therapeutic dose of 0.01 mg/kg (0.5mg/day assuming a 50 kg person). Intraperitoneal administration resulted in acute polyserositis due to the irritant properties of the vehicle (PEG 400 with 0.1% w/v Tween 80) and this was exacerbated by the presence of dutasteride, due to the physical properties of the compound. An intraperitoneal MNLD was therefore not identified in either species. Acute oral and intraperitoneal administration of dutasteride to mice and rats produced no evidence of unequivocal target organ toxicity. Reduction in the size of the prostate and seminal vesicles with accompanying microscopic changes were noted predominantly in treated males and are consistent with a reduction in dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels due to the pharmacological activity of dutasteride as a 5 \"-reductase (5AR) inhibitor. Long Term Toxicity Repeat oral dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats for 5 and 26 weeks (up to 500 mg/kg/day in males and 100 or 30 mg/kg/day, respectively, in females) and in dogs for 26 and 53 weeks (up to 50 or 10 mg/kg/day, respectively, in males and DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 28 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. females). The main findings consisted of changes in the male and female reproductive organs in both species and changes in the thyroid and other endocrine organs in dogs. These effects appear to be compatible with physiological changes in steroidogenic tissues and changes in the hypothalamic/pituitary/gonadal axis, which is typical of 5AR inhibition with subsequent decrease in DHT levels. Treatment-related findings seen in male reproductive organs included decrease in size and related histopathological changes in the prostate of rats and dogs, epithelial atrophy and decreased secretion of the seminal vesicles in rats, decreased epididymis weight in the rat and histopathological changes consistent with atrophy in the epididymis in dogs. Effects on the testis were limited to an increase in testis weight in rats following dosing for 5 weeks. There were no significant changes in spermatogenesis in the rat or dog. Treatment-related findings seen in female reproductive organs included decreased ovary and uterus/cervix weights, increased incidence of dioestrus or increased occurrence of ovarian (follicular) cysts in rats, and microscopic changes in the uterus and shifts in the oestrus cycle to the luteal phase in dogs. In dogs, there were changes in the thyroid consisting of a reversible increase in thyroid weight, with correlating microscopic changes of reduced colloid content and C-cell hyperplasia in the 26 week study and vacuolated follicular cells in the 53 week study. Other reversible changes in endocrine organs consisted of slight enlargement of chromophobes in the pars distalis of the pituitary and hypertrophy, cytoplasmic vacuolation and increased lipofuscin-like pigment in the adrenal cortex. Clinical signs indicative of a non-specific, reversible centrally mediated toxicity DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 29 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. were seen in some animals following repeat dosing. This was not associated with histopathological changes and occurred at exposures 425-fold in rats and 315-fold in dogs the clinical serum concentration at steady state (40 ng/mL). Due to the expected dutasteride-related effects as a result of 5AR inhibition, it was not possible to establish no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) in the repeat dose studies. However, in the 26 week rat and 53 week dog studies, there were no other toxicologically significant effects in female rats at up to 84-fold the clinical exposure of 40ng/mL, in male rats at up to 17-fold the clinical exposure, in females dogs at up to 203-fold the clinical exposure or in male dogs at up to 117-fold the clinical exposure. Special Toxicity Acute dermal application of dutasteride in rabbits caused slight but reversible irritancy. The estimated dermal LD50 of dutasteride in rabbits is >2,000mg/kg. In an acute dermal absorption study in rabbits at doses of 0.1 to 40 mg/kg, dutasteride was detected in the serum. Slight to moderate dermal irritancy was observed in treated and control groups. However, additional findings (including subcutaneous hemorrhaging) predominately in treated animals and macroscopic observations (multiple red areas in the skin) in animals at 40 mg/kg suggest that dutasteride is a dermal irritant. Acute ocular application of dutasteride in rabbits caused slight iridial irritation and slight to moderate conjunctival irritation, which were reversible within 72h. Dermal application of dutasteride in guinea pigs demonstrated no sensitizing effect. DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 30 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. In vitro, dutasteride (0.0111mg/mL) did not increase haemolysis or the level of free haemoglobin in human erythrocytes and did not increase protein flocculation, turbidity or precipitation in human plasma. Both dutasteride (0.0111mg/mL) and the vehicle control (a complexing agent) produced minimal evidence of perivascular irritation in mice. Dutasteride produced no intravenous irritation in rabbits. Reproduction and Teratology In a fertility study, male rats orally administered dutasteride (0.05 to 500mg/kg/day) for up to 31 weeks showed reversible dose- and time-dependent decreases in fertility, reductions in the weights of seminal vesicles, prostate and epididymides and microscopic changes in these male reproductive organs. The effects are consistent with the pharmacological activity of dutasteride. No effects were noted in the testis, and sperm concentration and motility were unaffected by treatment. The decrease in fertility with dutasteride is likely to be related to a failure of copulatory plug formation as a consequence of the decreased weight of the seminal vesicles and prostate. As such a mechanism is not thought to be relevant to species that do not form copulatory plugs, this finding is considered to be of no clinical concern. Furthermore, the decreased fertility in the rat was not associated with an effect on spermatogenesis. In an oral fertility study in female rats, the NOAEL for the F0 generation was 0.05mg/kg/day. Fetal body weight was reduced at all dosages of dutasteride (0.05 to 30mg/kg/day) and feminisation of male fetuses occurred at $2.5mg/kg/day. In an oral embryofetal development study in rats, the NOAEL for the F0 generation was 0.05mg/kg/day. Fetal body weight was reduced at $2.5mg/kg/day and feminisation of male fetuses and F1 male pups occurred at all dosages of DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 31 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. dutasteride (0.05 to 30mg/kg/day). Increased incidences of skeletal variations considered to be reversible delays in ossification associated with reduced body weight were noted at 12.5 and 30mg/kg/day. In a rabbit oral embryofetal development study, the NOAEL for the F0 generation was 200mg/kg/day. Dutasteride produced feminisation of male fetuses at all dosages (30 to 200mg/kg/day). Fusion of the jugal and zygomal bones was noted in a minority of fetuses at all dosages, but it is uncertain whether this was unequivocally related to treatment. In a further rabbit study, oral dosing at 0.05 to 30mg/kg/day also produced feminisation of male fetuses at all dosages. Feminisation of male fetuses is an expected effect of the pharmacological activity of dutasteride, which as a 5AR inhibitor inhibits the conversion of testosterone to DHT. In the male rat fertility study, low levels of dutasteride were detected in the serum of untreated female rats mated to treated males and, in humans, dutasteride was detected in semen at a maximum concentration of 14.0ng/mL following repeated oral dosing for 12 months. To determine the effects of dutasteride on embryo-fetal development of male fetuses, an intravenous embryofetal development study was conducted in the rhesus monkey. Intravenous administration of dutasteride at doses up to 2,010ng/animal/day during embryofetal development did not produce adverse maternal toxicity, fetal toxicity or feminisation of male offspring. The high dose represents at least a 186-fold multiple of the potential maximum daily dose from 5mL semen from a man treated with dutasteride at 0.5mg/day (assuming 100% absorption), for a 50kg woman. Dutasteride is highly bound to proteins in human semen (>96%), potentially reducing the amount of dutasteride available for vaginal absorption. In an oral pre- and -post natal rat study, the NOAEL for the F0 generation was DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 32 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. 0.05mg/kg/day. Earlier onset of vaginal patency was noted in F1 females at 2.5, 12.5 and 30mg/kg/day. Feminisation (decreased anogenital distance) was noted at all dosages (0.05 to 30mg/kg/day) in F1 males. At $2.5 mg/kg/day, F1 males had increased incidences of hypospadia resulting in decreased fertility and increased occurrence of inflammation of the genitourinary tract and prostatitis. Prostate and seminal vesicle weights were reduced at $2.5mg/kg/day in F1 males. These changes are expected effects of the pharmacological activity of dutasteride. Mutagenicity Dutasteride and the 4'-hydroxy metabolite of dutasteride, showed no evidence of mutagenic activity in the Ames test at concentrations up to 5,000:g/plate in the presence or absence of S9 metabolic activation. Similarly, the 1,2-dihydro metabolite of dutasteride, demonstrated no mutagenic activity in a miniwell Ames test at concentrations up to 800:g/well in the presence or absence of S9 metabolic activation. Dutasteride did not show any evidence of clastogenic activity in vitro in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells at concentrations up to 1,150:g/mL or in vivo in rat micronucleus tests at dose levels of up to 1,500mg/kg/day for 6 days. Carcinogenicity In a mouse oral carcinogenicity study, an increased incidence of benign hepatocellular adenomas was noted at 250mg/kg/day (299-fold the clinical exposure of 40ng/mL) in females only, but this was considered not to be related to treatment since the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas was within the historical control range for female B6C3F1 mice, and therefore does not represent a carcinogenic risk to humans. There were no effects on tumour profile in males at DCTM:\\399\\501\\2003_07_14\\15_Avodart_pristine.wpd 33 GlaxoSmithKline Inc. up to 500mg/kg/day (293-fold the clinical exposure). In a rat oral carcinogenicity study, an increased incidence of benign interstitial cell tumours in the testes was noted at 53mg/kg/day. This was considered likely to be due to an elevation in circulating luteinizing hormone levels as a result of an effect on the hypothalamic/pituitary/testicular axis. At tumorigenic doses in rats, luteinizing hormone levels were increased by 167%. There were no effects on tumour profile in males at up to 7.5mg/kg/day (78-fold the clinical exposure) or in females at up to 15mg/kg/day (183-fold the clinical exposure).

Such an exemption will effectively allow the named practitioner to administer, prescribe, provide or sell methadone to patients under their professional care for analgesia, subject to certain specified terms and conditions. Exemptions are issued by the Office of Controlled Substances, Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, directly (see AVAILABILITY OF DOSAGE FORMS), or in some provinces, through the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Pharmacists may supply methadone to a practitioner holding such an exemption. ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Methadone hydrochloride is a synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation and detoxification or maintenance in opiate addiction. The methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is 2 more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe. When administered orally, methadone is approximately one-half as potent as when given parenterally. Oral administration results in a delay of the onset, a lowering of the peak, and an increase in the duration of analgesic effect. The steady-state elimination half-life of methadone is approximately 25 hours. Large inter-individual variability in elimination half-life may necessitate 2 to 9 days for steady-state serum levels. Acutely, methadone has similar effects to other opioids; however, its pharmacological properties are significantly different from other opioid agonists in that it is extremely long-acting (36 to 48 hours) in humans. INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE METADOL (Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Concentrate) is indicated for the relief of severe pain. In general, METADOL, as an analgesic, should not be used in opioid naive patients. CONTRAINDICATIONS METADOL (Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Concentrate) is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug. METADOL should not be given to patients with diarrhea which is associated with pseudomembranous colitis caused by cephalosporins, lincomycins (possibly including topical clindamycin), or penicillins, or to patients having diarrhea caused by poisoning, until toxic material has been eliminated from the gastrointestinal tract. WARNINGS 3 METADOL (Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Concentrate) is for oral administration only. This preparation must not be injected. It is recommended that METADOL tablets and oral concentrate, if dispensed, be packaged in child-resistant containers and kept out of the reach of children to prevent accidental ingestion. Methadone Hydrochloride, a synthetic opioid, is a controlled substance (Classification N) under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). It is available only through physicians who have received an exemption from the Minister of Health Canada to prescribe methadone pursuant to section 56 of the CDSA. Appropriate security measures should be taken to safeguard stocks of methadone against diversion. DRUG DEPENDENCE - METHADONE CAN PRODUCE DRUG DEPENDENCE OF THE MORPHINE TYPE AND, THEREFORE, HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BEING ABUSED. PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPENDENCE, PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE, AND TOLERANCE MAY DEVELOP UPON REPEATED ADMINISTRATION OF METHADONE AND IT SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED AND ADMINISTERED WITH THE SAME DEGREE OF CAUTION APPROPRIATE TO THE USE OF MORPHINE. Interaction with Other Central-Nervous-System Depressants: Methadone should be used with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, other tricyclic antidepressants, and other CNS depressants (including alcohol). Respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. tranquillizers, sedative-hypnotics, Anxiety: Since methadone, as used by tolerant subjects as a constant maintenance dosage, is not a tranquillizer, patients who are maintained on this drug will react to life problems and stresses with the same symptoms of anxiety as do other individuals. The physician should not confuse such symptoms with those of opioid abstinence and should not attempt to treat anxiety by increasing the dosage of methadone. The action of methadone in maintenance treatment is limited to the control of opioid symptoms and is ineffective for relief of general anxiety. Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure: The respiratory depressant effects of methadone and its capacity to elevate cerebrospinal-fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of increased intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce side effects that may 4 obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. In such patients, methadone must be used with caution and only if it is deemed essential. Asthma and Other Respiratory Conditions: Methadone should be used with caution in patients having an acute asthmatic attack, in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in individuals with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, preexisting respiratory depression, hypoxia, or hypercapnia. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of narcotics may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Hypotensive Effect: The administration of methadone may result in severe hypotension in an individual whose ability to maintain his blood pressure has already been compromised by a depleted blood volume or concurrent administration of such drugs as the phenothiazines or certain anaesthetics. Analgesia: In general methadone should not be used in opioid naive patients. Use in Ambulatory Patients: Methadone may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. The patient should be cautioned accordingly. Methadone, like other opioids, may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. Use in Pregnancy: Methadone is not recommended for obstetrical analgesia. Safe use of methadone in pregnancy has not been established in relation to possible adverse effects on fetal development. Therefore, methadone should not be used in pregnant women, unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Care of such patients should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of such patients. It is the physician’s responsibility to ensure that female patients are fully informed concerning the possible risks to a pregnant woman or her unborn child from the use of methadone. Breast-feeding may result in the passage of opioids or other substances into the breast milk. Use of methadone in nursing mothers is not recommended, unless in the opinion of the treating physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. 5 PRECAUTIONS There is significant risk of respiratory depression if the patient is switched abruptly from other opioids to methadone. Conversion to methadone should be undertaken with caution. Special-Risk Patients: METADOL (Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Concentrate) should be given with caution and the initial dose should be reduced in certain patients, such as the elderly or debilitated and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture. Acute Abdominal Conditions: The administration of methadone or other narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Opioid antagonist or mixed agonist/antagonist drugs: Patients who are on prolonged methadone therapy may experience withdrawal symptoms when given opioid antagonists (e.g. naloxone etc.) or mixed agonist/antagonist drugs (e.g. pentazocine etc.). Rifampin: The concurrent administration of rifampin may possibly reduce the blood concentration of methadone to a degree sufficient to produce withdrawal symptoms. The mechanism by which rifampin may decrease blood concentrations of methadone is not fully understood, although enhanced microsomal drug-metabolized enzymes may influence drug disposition. Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors: Therapeutic doses of meperidine have precipitated severe reactions in patients concurrently receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors or those who have received such agents within 14 days. Similar reactions thus far have not been reported with methadone; but if the use of methadone is necessary in such patients, a sensitivity test should be performed in which repeated small incremental doses are administered over the course of several hours while the patient's condition and vital signs are under careful observation. Desipramine: Blood levels of desipramine have increased with concurrent methadone therapy. ADVERSE REACTIONS 6 Initial Administration: Initially, the dosage of methadone should be carefully titrated to the individual. Induction too rapid for the patient’s sensitivity is more likely to produce the following effects. THE MAJOR HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH METHADONE, AS WITH OTHER OPIOID ANALGESICS, ARE RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, CIRCULATORY DEPRESSION. RESPIRATORY ARREST, SHOCK AND CARDIAC ARREST HAVE OCCURRED. The most frequently observed adverse reactions with methadone include lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not suffering severe chronic pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable. Some adverse reactions may be alleviated in the ambulatory patient if the individual lies down. Other adverse reactions include the following: Central Nervous System: Euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, headache, insomnia and/or early awakenings, agitation, disorientation, and visual disturbances. Gastrointestinal: Dry mouth, anorexia, constipation, and biliary tract spasm. Cardiovascular: Flushing of the face, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, and syncope. Genitourinary: Urinary retention or hesitancy, antidiuretic effect, and reduced libido and/or potency. Allergic: Pruritus, urticaria, other skin rashes, edema, and rarely, haemorrhagic urticaria. Haematologic: Reversible thrombocytopenia has been described in an opioid addict with chronic hepatitis. Maintenance on a Stabilized Dose: During prolonged administration of methadone, there is a gradual, yet progressive disappearance of side effects over a period of several weeks. However, constipation and sweating persist. SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE Symptoms--Serious overdosage of methadone is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence 7 progressing to stupor or coma, maximally constricted pupils, skeletal-muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin and, sometimes, bradycardia and hypotension. In severe overdosage, particularly by the intravenous route, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death may occur. Treatment--Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. If a non-tolerant person, especially a child, takes a large dose of methadone, effective narcotic antagonists are available to counter-act the potentially lethal respiratory depression. THE PHYSICIAN MUST REMEMBER, HOWEVER, THAT METHADONE IS A LONG-ACTING DEPRESSANT (THIRTY-SIX TO FORTY-EIGHT HOURS), WHEREAS THE ANTAGONISTS ACT FOR MUCH SHORTER PERIODS (ONE TO THREE HOURS). The patient must, therefore, be monitored continuously for recurrence of respiratory depression and treated repeatedly with the opioid antagonist as needed. If the diagnosis is correct and respiratory depression is due only to overdosage of methadone, the use of respiratory stimulants is not indicated. An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular depression. Intravenously administered opioid antagonists (e.g. naloxone hydrochloride) are the drugs of choice to reverse signs of intoxication. These agents should be given repeatedly until the patient's status remains satisfactory. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. NOTE: IN AN INDIVIDUAL PHYSICALLY DEPENDENT ON OPIOIDS, THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE USUAL DOSE OF OPIOID ANTAGONIST WILL PRECIPITATE AN ACUTE WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME. THE SEVERITY OF THIS SYNDROME WILL DEPEND ON THE DEGREE OF PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE AND THE DOSE OF THE ANTAGONIST ADMINISTERED. THE USE OF AN OPIOID ANTAGONIST IN SUCH A PERSON SHOULD BE AVOIDED IF POSSIBLE. IF IT MUST BE USED TO TREAT SERIOUS RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN THE PHYSICALLY DEPENDENT PATIENT, THE ANTAGONIST SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED WITH EXTREME CARE AND BY TITRATION WITH SMALLER THAN USUAL DOSES OF THE ANTAGONIST (10 - 20% OF THE USUAL RECOMMENDED INITIAL DOSE OF THE ANTAGONIST). 8 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION METADOL (Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Concentrate) can only be prescribed by physicians who have received an exemption pursuant to section 56 of the CDSA from the Minister of Health Canada to prescribe methadone (see AVAILABILITY OF DOSAGE FORMS). Patients prescribed methadone should be carefully monitored and provided appropriate supportive psychological and social services. For relief of Severe Pain - Dosage should be carefully titrated and adjusted according to the severity of the pain and response of the patient. In general, METADOL, should not be used in opioid naive patients. The usual adult oral dose is 2.5 to 10 mg every 4 hours during the first 3 to 5 days, followed by a fixed dose every 8 to 12 hours depending on the patient’s requirements. In geriatric patients the dosage schedule could be given on a once daily basis. Special Considerations For A Pregnant Patient: Caution shall be taken in the maintenance treatment of pregnant patients. Dosage levels should be kept as low as possible if continued methadone treatment is deemed necessary. It is the physicians responsibility to assure that each female patient be fully informed concerning the possible risks to a pregnant woman or her unborn child from the use of methadone. Special Limitations treatment of patients under age 18: The safety, effectiveness and dosage regimen of methadone for use in the treatment of adolescents have not been established.

The analgesic effect and other morphine-like properties of methadone are exhibited chiefly by the l-form. The effect of methadone in common laboratory animal paradigms is qualitatively the same as that of morphine, e.g., the Straub reaction in mice, purposeless excitement in cats, and effects on behaviour and reflex activity in decorticate, decerebrate and spinal dogs and cats. Methadone has an effect similar to that of morphine on circulation and respiration and on smooth muscle. In rats or dogs chronically injected, tolerance to the analgesic effect of methadone develops at nearly the same rate as for morphine. However, dogs rendered only moderately tolerant to methadone are even more tolerant to other opioids than they are to methadone itself. The heightened activity and increased lability found for methadone in the rat may be related to the persistence of pharmacologically active concentrations of the drug. Exposure to the prenatal period produces a significant delay in postnatal brain growth associated with a reduction in brain DNA content measured at 21 days of age. Studies of plasma drug concentrations indicate a plasma half- life in the rat of only a few hours, but studies using tritiated methadone indicate that following prenatal administration, methadone accumulates and persists in neonatal brain and liver for long periods and may alter the maturation of the cholinergic-adrenergic or catecholamine systems. Gravid rats administered a 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg regimen of methadone on the last two weeks of gestation showed blood levels of methadone which were dose-related, corresponding to the levels found in human subjects receiving daily maintenance doses of approximately 30, 60 and 100 mg, respectively. Methadone, like morphine, blocks ovulation in the rat but only at doses approaching toxicity. TOXICOLOGY 20 In animals methadone is three to ten times more toxic than morphine, according to the species, and two to three times more toxic than meperidine. In comparative acute toxicity studies in rats, methadone on a weight-for weight basis is about 10 times more toxic than morphine orally, about 6 times more toxic subcutaneously, and about 25 times more toxic intravenously. The l-isomer of methadone, which accounts for nearly all the analgesic activity of the racemic mixture, is little if any more toxic than dl-methadone. The following Table summarizes the acute toxicity data for dl-methadone obtained in rats and mice: Route s.c. i.p. i.v. Mouse LD50 values (mg/kg) Rat 27 31 18 48 33 - A single dog injected subcutaneously with 50 mg/kg of dl-methadone suffered violent convulsions, and died 4 hours after injection. Rats administered a daily dose of 4 mg/kg methadone hydrochloride subcutaneously for ten weeks showed retarded growth. At autopsy, the only gross change noted was a slight increase in liver weight to body weight ratio. Considerable local subcutaneous irritation was observed at the injection sites. Young adult mongrel female dogs (n=8) injected twice daily on weekdays, and once daily on weekends, with a dose of 2 mg/kg of methadone for up to 16 weeks, exhibited the following extreme side effects: general depression, narcosis, and sedation. Tolerance to these effects were shown to develop much more slowly with methadone than with morphine. Other long-term effects were bradycardia to which no tolerance developed, vomiting, and reduction in voltages of P and R waves on the electrocardiogram. Signs observed after withdrawal of methadone included increase in resting respiratory rate, tachycardia, loss of appetite, and pronounced muscular tremors, with twitching and rigidity. 21 Methadone has been found to be teratogenic in the hamster. However, reproduction studies in rats and rabbits revealed no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity. Administration of a 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg/kg regimen of methadone to gravid rats on the last two weeks of gestation showed a dose-related increase in resorptions and stillbirths, but no teratogenicity. The two intermediate dose levels produced body weights that were reduced at birth but similar to controls by weaning. Behavioral teratology studies have suggested that dose levels producing a relatively high maternal and offspring mortality may yield survivors that are more resistant to the toxic effects of the drug and thus not show effects seen among the lower dose-level groups. 22 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13.

The primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of famotidine is inhibition of gastric juice secretion. Famotidine reduces the acid and pepsin content, as well as the volume, of basal, nocturnal, and stimulated gastric secretion. INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE Famotidine is indicated in the treatment of the following conditions where a controlled reduction of gastric secretion is required: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Treatment of acute duodenal ulcer; Prophylactic use in duodenal ulcer; Treatment of acute benign gastric ulcer; Treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions (e.g., Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome); Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); Maintenance of remission of patients with GERD. Famotidine injection is indicated in some hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions or intractable ulcers, or as an alternative to the oral dosage form for short-term use in patients who are unable to take oral medication. CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Cross sensitivity in this class of compounds has been observed. Therefore, famotidine should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to other H2-receptor antagonists. PRECAUTIONS Patients with Moderate or Severe Renal Insufficiency Since CNS adverse effects have been reported in patients with moderate and severe renal insufficiency, longer intervals between doses or lower doses may need to be used in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 - 50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) renal insufficiency to adjust for the longer elimination half-life of famotidine (see HUMAN PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Drug Interactions Studies with famotidine in man, in animal models, and in vitro have shown no significant interference with the disposition of compounds metabolized by the hepatic microsomal enzymes, e.g., cytochrome P450 system. Compounds tested in man have included warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, diazepam, aminopyrine and antipyrine. Indocyanine green as an index of hepatic blood flow and/or hepatic drug extraction has been tested and no significant effects have been found. In addition, studies with famotidine have shown no augmentation of expected blood alcohol levels resulting from alcohol ingestion. Use in Gastric Ulcer Gastric malignancy should be excluded prior to initiation of therapy of gastric ulcer with famotidine. Symptomatic response of gastric ulcer to therapy with famotidine does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Use in Pregnancy Reproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses of up to 2000 and 500 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 2500 and 625 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively), and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to famotidine. There are, however, no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Since the safe use of famotidine in pregnant women has not been established, the benefits of treatment with famotidine should be weighed against potential risks. Nursing Mothers Famotidine is detectable in human milk. Nursing mothers should either stop this drug or should stop nursing. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Use in Elderly Patients No dosage adjustment is required based on age (see HUMAN PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Dosage adjustments in the case of moderate or severe renal impairment is necessary (see PRECAUTIONS, Patients with Moderate or Severe Renal Insufficiency and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Moderate or Severe Renal Insufficiency). ADVERSE REACTIONS Famotidine is usually well tolerated; most adverse reactions have been mild and transient. The adverse reactions listed below have been reported during clinical trials in 2333 patients. In those controlled clinical trials in which famotidine was compared to placebo, the overall incidence of adverse experiences in the group which received famotidine 40 mg at bedtime, was similar to the placebo group. No antiandrogenic or other adverse hormonal effects have been observed. The following adverse reactions have been reported at a rate greater than 1% in patients on therapy with famotidine in controlled clinical trials, and may be causally related to the drug: headache (4.6 %), dizziness (1.2 %), constipation (1.2 %) and diarrhea (1.6 %). Other reactions have been reported in clinical trials but occurred under circumstances where a causal relationship could not be established. However, in these rarely reported events, that possibility cannot be excluded. Therefore, these observations are listed to serve as alerting information to physicians.

In addition, transient irritation at the injection site has been observed with famotidine injection. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was marketed: urticaria, liver enzymes abnormalities, cholestatic jaundice, anaphylaxis, angioedema. Toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported very rarely with H2 receptor antagonists. As with other H2- receptor antagonists, cases of bradycarida, A-V block and other arrhythmias have been reported rarely in patients treated with famotidine. The following adverse reactions have been reported; however, a causal relationship to therapy with famotidine has not been established: agitation, confusion, hallucinations, grand mal seizures, rare cases of impotence, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, leukopenia and agranulocytosis. Gynecomastia has been reported rarely. In most cases that were followed up, it was reversible after discontinuing treatment. Laboratory Abnormalities Laboratory parameters may be affected during treatment with famotidine, but the changes are usually not considered serious. Among the laboratory changes that were reported during clinical trials were increases in AST, ALT, BUN, and serum creatinine. These changes were rarely of clinical significance. Only three patients had to be discontinued from therapy because of laboratory adverse experiences, however laboratory abnormalities were present at baseline. SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE There is no experience to date with deliberate overdosage. Doses of up to 800 mg/day have been employed in patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions with no serious adverse effects. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Unabsorbed material should be removed from the gastrointestinal tract, the patient should be monitored, and supportive therapy should be employed. The oral LD50 of famotidine in male and female rats and mice was > 5000 mg/kg. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION DUODENAL ULCER Acute Therapy The recommended adult oral dosage of famotidine for acute duodenal ulcer is 40 mg once a day at bedtime. Treatment should be given for 4 - 8 weeks, but the duration of treatment may be shortened if healing can be documented. Healing occurs within 4 weeks in most cases of duodenal ulcer. Maintenance Therapy For the prevention of recurrence of duodenal ulcer, it is recommended that therapy with famotidine be continued with a dose of 20 mg once a day at bedtime, for a duration of up to 6 - 12 months depending on the severity of the condition. BENIGN GASTRIC ULCER Acute Therapy The recommended adult oral dosage for acute benign gastric ulcer is 40 mg once a day at bedtime. Treatment should be given for 4 to 8 weeks, but the duration of treatment may be shortened if healing can be documented. PATHOLOGICAL HYPERSECRETORY CONDITIONS (SUCH AS ZOLLINGER-ELLISON SYNDROME) The dosage of famotidine in patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions varies with the individual patient. The recommended adult oral starting dose for pathological hypersecretory conditions is 20 mg every six hours. In some patients, a higher starting dose may be required. Doses should be adjusted to individual patient needs and should continue as long as clinically indicated. Doses up to 800 mg/day have been administered to some patients with severe Zollinger- Ellison syndrome. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE The recommended dosage for the symptomatic relief of gastroesophageal reflux disease is 20 mg of famotidine twice a day. For the treatment of esophageal erosion or ulceration associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, the recommended dosage is 40 mg of famotidine twice a day. For the maintenance of remission of patients with GERD, the recommended dosage is 20 mg of famotidine twice a day. Intravenous Administration In some hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions or intractable ulcers, or in patients who are unable to take oral medication, famotidine injection may be administered. The recommended dosage is 20 mg every 12 hours. Intravenous injection therapy should be changed to oral treatment as soon as the acute situation is under control. Concomitant Use with Antacids Antacids may be given concomitantly if needed. Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Moderate or Severe Renal Insufficiency In patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 -50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal insufficiency, the elimination half-life of famotidine is increased. For patients with severe renal insufficiency, it may exceed 20 hours, reaching approximately 24 hours in anuric patients. Since CNS adverse reactions have been reported in patients with moderate and severe renal insufficiency, to avoid excess accumulation of the drug in patients with moderate and renal insufficiency, the dose of famotidine should be reduced to half the dose or the dosing interval may be prolonged to 36 - 48 hours as indicated by the patient’s clinical response. In patients with advanced renal insufficiency, i.e., with a creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min., the elimination half-life of famotidine may exceed 20 hours reaching approximately 24 hours in anuric patients. To avoid excess accumulation of the drug, the dosing interval of famotidine may be prolonged to 36 - 48 hours as indicated by the patient’s clinical response. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION I.

PHARMACOLOGY HUMAN PHARMACOLOGY I In both normal volunteers and hypersecretors, famotidine inhibited basal nocturnal and daytime gastric secretion, as well as secretion stimulated by a variety of stimuli, such as pentagastrin and food. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurred within one hour; the maximum effect was dose-dependent, occurring within one to three hours. Duration of inhibition of secretion was 10 to 12 hours. After intravenous administration, the maximum effect was achieved within 30 minutes. Single intravenous doses of 10 and 20 mg inhibited basal nocturnal secretion for a period of 10 - 12 hours. The 20 mg dose was associated with the longest duration of action in most subjects. Single oral doses of 20 and 40 mg inhibited basal nocturnal acid secretion in all subjects; mean gastric acid secretion was inhibited by 86% and 94%, respectively, for a period of at least 10 hours. Similar doses given in the morning suppressed food-stimulated acid secretion in all subjects, with mean suppression of 76% and 84%, respectively, 3 to 5 hours after drug, and of 25% and 30%, respectively, 8 to 10 hours after drug; however, in some subjects who received the 20 mg dose, the antisecretory effect was dissipated earlier, within 6 - 8 hours. There was no cumulative effect with repeated doses. The basal nocturnal intragastric pH was raised by evening doses of 20 and 40 mg of famotidine to mean values of 5.0 and 6.4, respectively. When famotidine was given in the morning, the basal daytime interdigestive pH at 3 and 8 hours after 20 or 40 mg of famotidine was raised to about 5.0. Fasting and postprandial serum gastrin levels may be slightly elevated during periods of drug antisecretory effect, and with chronic therapy an increase in gastric bacterial flora may occur. Gastric emptying and exocrine pancreatic function are not affected by famotidine. The presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease appears to correlate best with the percentage of time over 24 hours during which the esophagus is exposed to acid. In gastroesophageal reflux disease patients, 20 mg twice a day and 40 mg twice a day of famotidine reduced intraesophageal acid exposure into the normal range as measured by 24 hour intraesophageal pH monitoring. In clinical studies of gastroesophageal reflux disease patients with endoscopically verified erosive or ulcerative esophagitis, 40 mg twice a day was more effective than 20 mg twice a day in healing esophageal legions. Both dosage regimens were superior to placebo. In patients treated for six months with famotidine, relapse of esophageal erosion or ulceration was significantly less than in patients treated with placebo. Famotidine was also shown to be superior to placebo in preventing symptomatic deterioration. Other Effects Systemic pharmacologic effects of famotidine in the CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory or endocrine systems have not been found to date. Serum prolactin levels do not rise after intravenous bolus doses of 20 mg of famotidine and no antiandrogenic effects have been detected. Pharmacokinetics Famotidine is incompletely absorbed. The mean bioavailability of oral doses is 40 - 45%. Bioavailability may be slightly increased by food, or slightly decreased by antacids; however, these effects are of no clinical consequence. Famotidine undergoes minimal first-pass metabolism. After oral doses, peak plasma levels occur in 1 - 3 hours. Plasma levels after multiple doses are similar to those after single doses. Fifteen to 20% of famotidine in plasma is protein bound. Famotidine has an elimination half-life of 2.5 - 3.5 hours. Famotidine is eliminated by renal (65 - 70%) and metabolic (30 - 35%) routes. Renal clearance is 250 - 450 mL/min., indicating some tubular excretion. Twenty-five to 30% of an oral dose and 65 - 70% of an intravenous dose are recovered in the urine as unchanged compound. The only metabolite identified in man is the S-oxide. There is a close relationship between creatinine clearance values and the elimination half-life of famotidine. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, i.e., creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min., elimination half-life of famotidine may exceed 20 hours and adjustment of dosing intervals may be necessary (see PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). In elderly patients, there are no clinically significant age-related changes in the pharmacokinetics of famotidine. ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY II Famotidine inhibits gastric secretion evoked by histamine and other secretagogues. In dogs, the ED50 was 0.03 mg/kg after oral or intravenous administration of famotidine. An oral dose of 2.1 mg/kg in dogs inhibited gastric secretion for at least 24 hours. An oral dose of 3 mg/kg one hour prior to feeding inhibited the acid response in dogs during a 4-hour post feeding period by an average of 96%. Mechanism of Action Famotidine is a specific, competitive, H2-receptor antagonist. There was no effect in vitro on responses mediated by H1-histamine, beta1-adrenergic, or cholinergic receptors. Famotidine was inactive in radioligand binding to dopaminergic, neuroleptic, serotonergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, and purinergic sites. Famotidine was also inactive in an androgen receptor assay. The interaction between famotidine and H2-receptors is tissue-dependent. In guinea pig lungs and rabbit gastric glands the effects of famotidine were surmountable and readily reversible on washout, indicating classic competitive inhibition at the H2-receptor sites. However, in guinea pig atria, famotidine acted as a non-competitive H2 antagonist, and recovery after washout of famotidine was retarded. Absorption and Distribution The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of famotidine were studied in two animal species. Absorption was 28% in the rat and 43% in the dog. The plasma half-life in dogs was 2.5 hours, which was unchanged after repeated doses, indicating no tendency for the drug to accumulate. In rats, the highest levels of radioactivity after an oral dose of famotidine were found in the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, submandibular glands, arteries, epiphyseal membrane, fascia, and uvea. The distribution pattern was not affected on repeated dosing. Famotidine did not effectively cross the blood-brain or placental barrier of rats. It was present in rat milk. Metabolism and Excretion The only metabolite of famotidine in rat and dog urine was the sulfoxide derivative, which was present in minor amounts. Urinary and fecal excretion of radioactivity in rats accounted for 28% and 70%, respectively, of an oral dose, compared to 83% and 17% respectively, of an intravenous dose. About 2.4% of the dose in rats was excreted in the bile. Dogs excreted 45% of an oral dose in the urine, compared to 100% of an intravenous dose. Effects on Liver Microsomal Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes Famotidine did not affect pentobarbital or hexobarbital sleeping times and it did not affect ascorbic acid excretion, suggesting that famotidine does not induce drug-metabolizing enzymes. Famotidine caused none of the changes induced by cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of diazepam, warfarin, and propranolol. Famotidine produced only minimal suppression of aminopyrine and diazepam N- demethylase activity in vitro, and showed little affinity for testosterone hydroxylases of mouse liver in vitro. Gastrointestinal Effects other than Antisecretory Famotidine prevented gastric erosions induced in rats by cold restraint, water immersion, pyloric ligation, or drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, histamine or prednisolone; also duodenal ulcers caused by cysteamine and mepirizole. It also significantly accelerated the healing of the gastric lesions induced by acetic acid and the duodenal ulcers produced by mepirizole. The antiulcer effect of famotidine plus magnesium and aluminum hydroxides was greater than the sum of the effects of these drugs used separately. Famotidine inhibited the gastric lesions and hemorrhage resulting from blood removal and histamine injection in anaesthetized rats. In normal rats, famotidine had no effect on the concentration of gastric mucosal histamine, but it did reduce the levels of cAMP, particularly in response to histamine stimulation. In anaesthetized cats, famotidine had no effect on the intragastric electropotential when tested at intragastric doses more than ten-fold greater than those required to block gastric secretion maximally. Cardiorenal Effects The cardiorenal effects of famotidine were studied in dogs and rats. Ten mg/kg of famotidine administered orally were without effect on the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In anaesthetized dogs, intravenous administration of 1.0 and 4.0 mg/kg of famotidine was without effect on cardiovascular parameters relating to the autonomic nervous system, blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory function. In conscious dogs, an oral dose of 10 mg/kg was without diuretic effect. Central Nervous System Effects The effects of famotidine on the central nervous system were studied in squirrels, monkeys, mice, and cats. In monkeys famotidine had a bidirectional effect on lever pressing (avoidance response) causing an increase at the low dose (1.0 mg/kg p.o.) and a small decrease at 9 mg/kg. In mice following intraperitoneal administration of 6 to 150 mg/kg no overt behavioural signs or symptoms of central nervous system activity were observed. In mice famotidine was not active as an antagonist of the CNS actions of TRH, neurotensin, substance P, or amphetamine. Famotidine was free of major or minor tranquillizing, anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, ganglionic blocking, or dopaminergic activity. In cats, famotidine did not affect the EEG or arousal response but did prolong the duration of hippocampal after-discharge. Only 4% of the plasma concentration of the drug was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. Acute Toxicity TOXICOLOGY Species Mouse Mouse Rat Rat Sex M F M F M F M F Route P.O.x P.O.x I.V. (4%) I.V.

Subacute and Chronic Toxicity Famotidine is well tolerated by both rats and dogs at doses of 2 g/kg twice a day orally in subacute studies and at doses up to 1000 or 2000 mg/kg/day for one year in these species. Eosinophilic cytoplasmic granularity of gastric chief cells was seen at a higher incidence in rats given 200 mg/kg/day or more of the compound compared to controls. This is considered as a secondary effect due to the exaggerated pharmacologic activity of the compound at these extremely high dosage levels and is considered of no toxicologic significance. In a 106-week study in rats designed to study the carcinogenic potential of the compound, this gastric change did not progress to hyperplasia or neoplasia. Similarly, mice (given the compound for 92 weeks) showed no evidence of a neoplastic potential. Based on the results from studies performed using pharmacologically-related compounds, this change was fully reversible. Intravenous administration of famotidine was well tolerated by rats for 13 weeks at dosage levels of up to 20 mg/kg/day and by dogs, except for occasional emesis, at dosage levels of up to 10 mg/kg/day for 5 to 26 weeks. Reproduction Studies In studies with rats given oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg/day or intravenous doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 2500 and 250 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively), fertility and reproductive performance were not affected. Famotidine given orally to pregnant rats up to 2000 mg/kg/day or intravenously at dosage levels up to 200 mg/kg/day, from Days 7 to 17 of pregnancy did not reveal any evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. Oral administration of famotidine to pregnant rabbits from Days 6 to 18 of pregnancy at dosage levels up to 500 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of embryolethality or teratogenicity. Mutagenicity Famotidine was tested in a reverse-mutation test (Ames test) using Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with and without metabolic activation. No mutagenic potential was seen. These same studies were performed with famotidine/sodium, nitrite reaction mixture and C-nitroso derivatives of famotidine and they were also negative. Famotidine and C-nitroso derivatives of famotidine were tested in the rec-assay using Bacillus subtilis H17 and M45 and the tests were negative for DNA-damaging capacity of the compounds. In in vivo studies in mice, a micronucleus test and a chromosomal aberration test, no evidence of a mutagenic effect was seen. Carcinogenicity A 92-week oral carcinogenicity study was conducted in mice at doses of 20, 200 and 2000 mg/kg/day. No evidence of a carcinogenic potential was seen. A 106-week oral carcinogenicity study in rats given doses of 20, 200 and 2000 mg/kg/day did not reveal any carcinogenic potential for famotidine. Special Studies The effects of famotidine on the thyroid of rats were evaluated after five weeks of oral administration at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. No evidence of treatment-related alterations of serum thyroid hormone levels, thyroid weight or the microscopic appearance were seen after administration of famotidine. In immunogenicity studies, no effect on the production of IgE antibodies was seen in the sera of mice which were injected, once intraperitoneally, with famotidine alone (up to 2 mg/8 mL/kg) or coupled with either mouse serum albumin or ovalbumin. The sera were used to measure passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats which were then challenged with solutions of antigens similar to those antigens used for the initial dose in mice. Similarly, no evidence of an anaphylactic reaction was seen in guinea pigs challenged intravenously with famotidine after initiating doses (three times, subcutaneously, at six-day intervals) of up to 10 mg/mL. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15.

Other mechanisms leading to a reduction of blood glucose are also believed to be influenced by glyburide. The insertion of an alkylene chain on the benzene nucleus results in a product of very high potency. Schulz and Schmidt indicated that the presence of a sulfonamide (sulphaphenazoIe) decreased the distribution volume of glyburide without influence on the half-life of the oral hypoglycemic agent. As a result, insulin and serum concentrations of glyburide were higher and hypoglycemic attacks could he expected. Hirn and Konigstein have observed hypoglycemia when phenylbutazone and oxyphenbutazone were added to glyburide. Schulz and Schmidt confirmed that phenylbutazone has an enhancing effect on the blood-sugar-Iowering effect of glyburide and found higher insulin levels. The plasma haIf-life of glyburide did not change with phenylbutazone administration. However, a significant decrease in the renal excretion of the main metabolite of glyburide was observed, suggesting that the elimination in the bile may compensate for the amount not excreted in the urine. 2 Glyburide is highly bound to plasma proteins after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is completely metabolized by hydroxylation of the cyclohexyl ring into 3 cis and 4 trans derivatives in the liver and the kidneys play only a minor role in their biotransformation and elimination from plasma. The metabolites have no essential hypoglycemic effect and they are not stored in the body, but they are eliminated via the bile, and in approximately the same amounts in the urine conjugated to glucoronic acid and in the feces. Maximal plasma levels of insulin, after an oral dose of 5 mg of glyburide in normal subjects were reached 90 minutes after dosing. Minimal blood levels of glucose, after an oral dose of 5 mg of glyburide in normal subjects were reached 120 minutes after dosing corresponding to a reduction of about 35%. Comparative Bioavailability The relative bioavailability of Rhoxal-glyburide (10 mg) tablets and DiaBeta (10 mg) of Hoechst Canada Inc. were compared. The study was a single oral dose (2 x 5 mg of each brand) administered to each of 20 fasted healthy volunteers in a balanced randomized crossover design with a 7 day washout period. Glyburide was assayed in the human plasma using a validated HPLC method. The results of this biostudy are summarized in the following table: 3 Parameter DiaBeta Rhoxal-glyburide Percentage of DiaBeta AUCT* (ng•hrs/mL) AUCI* (ng•hrs/mL) Cmax* (ng/mL) Tmax (hrs)** t1/2 (hrs)** * Geometric mean (CV) 1446 (45) 1525 (44) 317 (36) 2.6 (0.9) 4.5 (3.3) 1336(44) 1425 (46) 329 (38) 2.1 (0.7) 4.6 (4.4) - 7.6 - 6.6 + 3.8 - - Complete details on the comparative bioavailability study are available upon request. INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE To control hyperglycemia in glyburide-responsive diabetes mellitus of stable, mild, non-ketosis- prone, maturity-onset or adult type which cannot be controlled by proper dietary management, exercise and weight reduction, or when insulin therapy is not appropriate. CONTRAINDICATIONS Rhoxal-glyburide (glyburide) should not be given to patients with known hypersensitivity or allergy to the active ingredient or any other component of the formulation. Glyburide should not be given to patients with: unstable and/or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; ketoacidosis; diabetic precoma; coma; in the presence of pre-existing complications peculiar to diabetes; during stress conditions such as severe infections, trauma or surgery; in the presence of liver disease or renal impairment; or frank jaundice. 4 Pregnancy and Lactation During pregnancy, no oral anti-diabetic drugs should be given. Due to the possible excretion in human milk, the patient should discontinue nursing or discontinue taking the drug depending on the importance of the drug to the mother. If glyburide is discontinued, the patient should be transferred to insulin therapy. WARNINGS The use of Rhoxal-glyburide (glyburide) will not prevent the development of complications peculiar to diabetes mellitus. The use of glyburide must be considered as treatment in addition to a proper dietary regime and not as a substitute for diet. Over a period of time, patients may become progressively less responsive to therapy with oral hypoglycemic agents because of deterioration of their diabetic state. If a loss of adequate blood glucose lowering response to Rhoxal-glyburide is detected, the drug should be discontinued. 5 PRECAUTIONS Patient Selection and Follow-Up Careful selection of patients is important. It is imperative that there be rigid attention to diet, adherence to regular exercise, reduction of body weight in obese patients, careful adjustment of dosage, instruction of the patient on hypoglycemic reactions and their control as well as regular thorough follow-up examinations. Since the effects of oral hypoglycemic agents on the vascular changes and other long-term sequelae of diabetes mellitus are not fully known, patients receiving such drugs must be closely observed for both short and long-term complications. Periodic assessment of cardiovascular, ophthalmic, hematologic, renal and hepatic status is advisable. In patients stabilized on Rhoxal-glyburide (glyburide), loss of blood sugar control may occur in cases of acute intercurrent disease or in stressful situations such as trauma or surgery. Under these conditions, discontinuation of Rhoxal-glyburide and administration of insulin should be considered. Oral hypoglycemic agents should be administered with caution to patients with Addison's disease. The use of Rhoxal-glyburide is not recommended for women planning a pregnancy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS); these patients should be changed over to insulin therapy. 6 Hypoglycemic Reactions Severe hypoglycemia can be induced by all sulfonylurea drugs. Particularly susceptible are elderly subjects, patients with impaired hepatic and renal function, those who are debilitated or malnourished, and patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when the caloric intake is inadequate or after strenuous or prolonged exercise. Drug Interactions Patients who receive or discontinue certain medications while undergoing treatment with glyburide may experience changes in blood glucose control. Hypoglycemia may be potentiated when a sulfonylurea is used concurrently with agents such as: insulin and other oral antidiabetics, anabolic steroids and androgens, azapropazone, chloramphenicol, clofibrate, coumarin derivatives, cyclophosphamide, disopyramide, fenfluramine, fibrates, fluoxetine, ifosfamide, miconazole, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, oxyphenbutazone, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenylbutazone, probenecid, propranolol, quinolones, salicylates, sulfinpyrazone, sulfonamides, sympatholytic agents (e.g., beta-blockers, guanethidine), tetracyclines, tuberculostatics. Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood sugar control; these include: acetazolamide, barbiturates, corticosteroids, diazoxide, diuretics (thiazides, furosemide), glucagon, laxatives (after protracted use), nicotinic acid (in pharmacologic doses), 7 oral contraceptives (estrogen plus progestogen), phenothiazines, phenytoin, rifampin, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine) and thyroid hormones. Under the influence of sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation to hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent. Concurrent use of H2 receptor antagonists, clonidine or reserpine with glyburide may lead to either a potentiation or an attenuation of the blood-glucose-lowering effect. Both acute and chronic alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering action of glyburide in an unpredictable fashion. Intolerance to alcohol (disulfiram-like reaction: flushing, sensation of warmth, giddiness, nausea, and occasionally tachycardia) may occur in patients treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs. These reactions can be prevented by avoiding the use of alcohol. Barbiturates should be used cautiously in patients receiving an oral hypoglycemic agent, since their action may be prolonged. Glyburide may potentiate or weaken the effects of coumarin derivatives. Impairment of Alertness and Reaction Time Until optimal control has been achieved, when changing the antidiabetic preparation, or when the tablets have not been taken regularly, alertness and reaction time may be altered to such an extent that the patient cannot safely cope with road traffic or operate machinery. 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypoglycemia (See PRECAUTIONS) Severe hypoglycemia, which may be prolonged and has occasionally been life-threatening, may occur and mimics acute CNS disorders (see SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE). Hepatic and/or renal disease, malnutrition and/or irregular meals, exercise without adequate caloric supplementation, debility, advanced age, patient non-compliance, alcoholism, certain disorders of thyroid function, adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, excessive glyburide dosage, treatment with glyburide in the absence of indication or concurrent use with other agents may be predisposing factors. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, epigastric fullness and heartburn are common reactions. Vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain have also been reported. These tend to be dose related and may disappear when dosage is reduced. Dermatologic and Sensitivity Reactions Allergic and pseudoallergic skin reactions such as pruritus, erythema, urticaria, morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions have been reported in a number of patients. These may subside on continued use of glyburide, but if they persist the drug should be discontinued. Mild reactions such as urticaria may very rarely develop into serious and life-threatening reactions including dyspnea, hypotension or shock. Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been associated with the use of oral hypoglycemic drugs. Allergic vasculitis have been observed very rarely in patients receiving glyburide and in some circumstances may be life-threatening. 9 Cross-sensitivity to sulfonamides or their derivatives may occur in patients treated with oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents. Hematologic Reactions Rare cases of mild to severe thrombocytopenia which can manifest itself as purpura have been reported. Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia (which may be due to myelosuppression), erythrocytopenia, granulocytopenia, hemolytic anemia and aplastic anemia have been observed very rarely with glyburide therapy. These reactions may be reversible following discontinuation of the sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent. Metabolic Reactions Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been observed in patients treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs. Elevation of liver enzyme levels has been reported very rarely in patients treated with glyburide. In isolated cases, impairment of liver function (e.g., cholestasis and jaundice) and hepatitis have been observed which can regress after withdrawal of the drug or may lead to life-threatening liver failure. Endocrine Reactions Reduced radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid gland has been reported with oral hypoglycemic therapy. Other Adverse Reactions Transient visual disturbances may occur at the commencement of treatment due to fluctuations in blood glucose levels. 10 In isolated cases, reduction of serum sodium concentrations has been observed in patients receiving glyburide. SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with sulfonylureas may result in hypoglycemia, but it should be noted that the dosage which causes hypoglycemia varies widely, and may be within the accepted therapeutic range in sensitive individuals. The manifestations of hypoglycemia include: flushing or pallor, chilliness, excessive hunger, trembling, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, aggressiveness, depression, speech disorders, sensory and/or visual disturbances, helplessness, lassitude, shallow respiration or bradycardia. In more severe cases, the clinical symptoms of a stroke or coma appear. However, symptoms of hypoglycemia are not necessarily as typical as described above and sulfonylureas may cause insidious development of symptoms mimicking cerebrovascular insufficiency. (e.g., disordered sleep, somnolence, impaired alertness and reactions, confusion, delirium, cerebral convulsions, paralytic symptoms or loss of consciousness). Signs of adrenergic counter-regulation to hypoglycemia include: sweating, damp skin, anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmias. However, these symptoms may be milder or absent in patients who develop hypoglycemia gradually, patients with autonomic neuropathy, or patients who receive concurrent treatment with sympatholytic agents (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, reserpine, guanethidine). Discontinue medication and treat hypoglycemia by giving dextrose promptly and in sufficient quantity. 11 The symptoms of hypoglycemia nearly always subside when blood glucose control is attained. However, some sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemias may be refractory to treatment and susceptible to relapse, especially in elderly or malnourished patients. Continuous dextrose infusions for hours to days have been necessary. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION In diabetic subjects there is no fixed dosage regimen for management of blood glucose levels. Individual determination of the minimum dose that will lower the blood glucose adequately should be made. If the maximal recommended dose fails to lower blood glucose adequately in patients on initial trial, Rhoxal-glyburide (glyburide) should be discontinued. During the course of therapy a loss of effectiveness may occur. It is advisable to ascertain the contribution of the drug in the control of blood glucose by discontinuing the medication semi-annually or at least annually with careful monitoring of the patient. If the need for the drug is not evident, the drug should not be resumed. In some diabetic subjects short-term administration of the drug may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of blood sugar control. Adjustment of glyburide dosage should be considered whenever factors predisposing the patient to the development of hypo- or hyperglycemia such as weight or lifestyle changes, are present (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Newly-Diagnosed Diabetics 12 The initial dose is 5 mg daily (2.5 mg in patients over 60 years of age) and it should be continued for 5 to 7 days. Depending on the response, the dosage should then be either increased or decreased by steps of 2.5 mg. The maximum daily dose of glyburide is 20 mg (because higher doses normally have no additional effect on control of metabolic state). Occasionally, control is maintained with 2.5 mg daily. The majority of cases can be controlled by 5 to 10 mg (1 to 2 tablets) daily given as a single dose during or immediately after breakfast. Patients who eat only a light breakfast should defer the first dose of the day until lunchtime. If more than 10 mg (2 tablets) daily is required, the excess should be taken with the evening meal. Changeover From Other Oral Hypoglycemic Agents There is no exact dosage relationship between glyburide and other oral antidiabetic agents. Discontinue previous oral medication and start Rhoxal-glyburide 5 mg daily (2.5 mg in patients over 60 years of age). This also applies to patients changed over from the maximum dose of other oral antidiabetic medication. Determine maintenance dosage as in newly-diagnosed diabetics. Consideration must be given to the potency and duration of action of the previous antidiabetic agent. A break from medication may be required to avoid any summation of effects entailing a risk of hypoglycemia. Changeover From Insulin If a change from insulin to glyburide is contemplated in a patient with stable, mild, maturity-onset diabetes, treatment with insulin should be discontinued for a period of two or three days to determine whether any therapy other than dietary regulation and exercise is needed. During this 13 insulin-free interval, the patient's urine should be tested at least three times daily for glucose and ketone-bodies, and the results monitored carefully by a physician. The appearance of significant ketonuria accompanied by glucosuria within 12-24 hours after the withdrawal of insulin strongly suggests that the patient is ketosis-prone and precludes the change from insulin to Rhoxal- glyburide.

The pKa is 5.3. Composition In addition to the active ingredient glyburide, each tablet contains the non-medicinal ingredients lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate. Stability and Storage Recommendations Store at controlled room temperature 15E-30EC (59E-86EF). AVAILABILITY OF DOSAGE FORMS Rhoxal-glyburide 2.5 mg: Each white, round, flat-faced, bevelled-edge tablet, scored and engraved \"GLY\" over \"2.5\" on one side and plain on the other, contains 2.5 mg of glyburide. Available in bottles of 100 and 500, and in unit dose packages of 30 and 100. Rhoxal-glyburide 5 mg: Each white, capsule-shaped, flat-faced, bevelled-edge tablet, scored on one side and engraved \"GLY 5\" on the other, contains 5 mg of glyburide. Available in bottles of 100 and 500, and in unit dose packages of 30 and 100. 15 PHARMACOLOGY Animal In the isolated, perfused rat pancreas, glyburide produced a sustained rise in insulin output. In the presence of 0.5 mcg/mL of glyburide, isolated rat pancreatic islets released insulin continuously. When isolated pieces of rat pancreas were repeatedly exposed to glucose or glyburide for brief periods of time at intervals of 30 minutes, they consistently released insulin. In the presence of 300 mg% of glucose, glyburide (2.5 mcg/min.) increased effectively insulin output from isolated rat pancreas. Sirek et al. found that the beta adrenergic blocker, propranolol, inhibits sulphonylurea-stimulated insulin secretion in the dog and that the hypoglycemia produced by glyburide in the presence of propranolol could be the result of extrapancreatic effects. TOXICOLOGY The LD50 for white mice, rats and guinea pigs was found to be more than 15 g/kg body weight and for rabbits and beagles, more than 10 g/kg body weight when glyburide is given orally. The LD50 in rats following intraperitoneal injection is 6.3 to 8.4 g/kg body weight. Long-term feeding experiments were carried out in rats and dogs over the course of one year. Rats were given glyburide in their food in doses of approximately 0.2, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg body weight daily. The highest dose is equivalent to 350 times the minimal hypoglycemic dose in man. Organ function tests were carried out continuously. Hematological examination, blood sugar tests and urinary analyses were performed every three months. None of the rats showed any abnormal findings in the function tests or the blood and urine studies. Subsequent post-mortem 16 examination revealed no macroscopic or histological changes attributable to a toxic effect of glyburide. Dogs were given glyburide by mouth at dose levels of 0.4, 2.0 and 10.0 mg/kg body weight daily. The highest dose is equivalent to 650 times the minimal effective hypoglycemic dose in man. Regular checks of blood cell counts, blood glucose, urine, electrolytes, electrophoresis, BUN and serum enzyme levels (GPT, GOT, LDH, AP) showed no abnormalities. All the animals behaved normally during the period of the experiment. There was no vomiting or diarrhea, and their weights remained unchanged. Subsequent post-mortem examination and histological investigations showed no abnormality. Teratological tests were carried out in rats and rabbits. Rats were given 0.2, 20 and 2,000 mg/kg body weight of glyburide from day 7 to 16 of gestation. For rabbits the doses were 0.035, 3.5 and 350 mg/kg given from day 7 to 17 of gestation in a starch suspension by gastric tube. Examination of the intact fetuses, followed by examination of transverse sections of the stained skeleton, showed no evidence of teratogenic action. 17 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Balant L, Fabre J, Zahno GR.
